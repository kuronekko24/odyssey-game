## Lore & Setting

### The Universe

Humanity is not alone—and never was.

Five centuries ago, the first colony ships departed a dying Earth, following signals that promised salvation. What they found was the **Cradle Stars**: a cluster of habitable systems already touched by intelligent life. Two ancient species—the **Veth** and the **Korvani**—had been watching humanity's slow crawl toward the stars for generations.

The Cradle Stars are not a frontier. They are a crossroads.

---

### Timeline

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| **2187** | The Exodus begins. Twelve colony ships depart Earth following the "Shepherd Signal" |
| **2203** | First contact with the Veth in Sol Proxima. Peaceful, but wary |
| **2211** | Uurf established as humanity's first permanent colony |
| **2245** | The Korvani reveal themselves. Trade negotiations begin |
| **2267** | The Compact of Three signed—humanity, Veth, and Korvani agree to shared commerce |
| **2289** | Banx Station activated. Origin unknown. All three species claim ignorance |
| **2312** | The Spira Conflict—corporate wars over Vulcan Belt mining rights. 50,000 dead |
| **2340** | The Quiet Century begins. Relative peace, rapid expansion |
| **2456** | First expeditions into Uncharted Space. Most don't return |
| **2487** | The Breach. Something answers from the Void. Expeditions halted |
| **2512** | Present day. The Breach remains sealed. Uncharted Space beckons the brave and foolish |

---

### The Exodus

Earth didn't die in fire—it died in silence.

Centuries of exploitation left the planet a husk. Crops failed. Oceans acidified. By 2150, the writing was on the wall: humanity had perhaps fifty years before extinction. Then came the **Shepherd Signal**—a repeating transmission from beyond the solar system, containing star charts to the Cradle Stars.

No one knows who sent it. The Veth deny responsibility. The Korvani claim they detected it too. Some believe it was a trap. Others call it divine intervention.

Twelve arkships launched. Seven arrived. The other five were never found.

The survivors called their new home **Uurf**—an Old Norse word meaning "fate" or "destiny." It stuck.

---

### Alien Species

#### The Veth

*"They speak in riddles and trade in patience."*

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Appearance** | Tall, slender humanoids with pale blue-grey skin. Four eyes arranged in a diamond pattern. No visible mouth—they communicate through bioluminescent patterns and subsonic vibrations (translated by devices) |
| **Homeworld** | Unknown. They claim to be "between homes" |
| **Culture** | The Veth are wanderers—their massive generation ships drift through the Cradle Stars on centuries-long orbits. They value knowledge above all else and consider hoarding information a grave sin |
| **Economy** | They trade in data, star charts, and ancient artifacts. Veth merchants are respected but never fully trusted |
| **Relations** | Neutral toward humanity. They find humans "fascinatingly reckless" |

**Veth in Gameplay:**
- Veth merchants appear in major cities selling rare blueprints and star charts
- Veth generation ships are mobile trading posts in deep space
- High reputation with Veth unlocks exploration bonuses and hidden locations

#### The Korvani

*"Honor is profit. Profit is survival. Survival is everything."*

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Appearance** | Stocky, powerful builds with thick, scaled hide ranging from rust-red to deep bronze. Three-fingered hands with retractable claws. Pronounced brow ridges and tusks |
| **Homeworld** | Korvan Prime, a harsh volcanic world in the Aridian Reach system |
| **Culture** | Clan-based society built on martial honor and mercantile prowess. A Korvani's word is their bond—breaking a contract is punishable by exile or death |
| **Economy** | Korvani clans dominate heavy industry and mercenary work. They respect strength and despise cowardice |
| **Relations** | Wary respect for humanity. They admire human adaptability but consider us "soft" |

**Korvani in Gameplay:**
- Korvani clans offer mercenary contracts and escort missions
- Korvani-made weapons and armor are renowned for durability
- High reputation with Korvani unlocks combat bonuses and Hardcore zone safe passages
- Dust Port has a significant Korvani population

#### The Absent Ones (Precursors)

*"They built Banx. They carved the jump lanes. Then they vanished."*

Before the Veth, before the Korvani, someone else was here. Evidence of their presence is everywhere: the impossibly precise jump gate network, the self-maintaining systems of Banx Station, the strange resonance of Ethercrystals.

No one knows what they looked like. No one knows where they went. The Veth call them the **Weavers**. The Korvani call them the **First Flame**. Humans call them the **Absent Ones**.

Some believe they transcended physical form. Others believe they were destroyed by whatever waits in Uncharted Space. A few believe they're still watching.

---

### OMEN - The Entangled Currency

OMEN is impossible. That's what makes it valuable.

When Banx Station activated in 2289, it didn't just broadcast a financial protocol—it released **OMEN** into the universe. Not data. Not code. *Substance*. Each unit of OMEN is a quantum-entangled particle pair, half stored in Banx's core, half circulating through the economy.

**The Properties of OMEN:**

| Property | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| **Instant Transfer** | OMEN moves instantaneously across any distance via quantum entanglement. No lag. No intermediaries. No way to intercept |
| **Infinitely Divisible** | A single OMEN can be split into smallest fragments. Precision trading at any scale |
| **Finite Supply** | Exactly **1,000,000,000 OMEN** (one billion) exist. No more can be created. Ever. This is the hard limit of the universe |
| **Dual Nature** | OMEN exists as both digital currency AND physical token simultaneously. You can hold it in your hand or in your account—it's the same unit |

**Why OMEN Dominates:**
- No other currency can compete with instant, universal transfer
- The finite supply makes it inherently deflationary—it gains value over time
- Counterfeiting is impossible (you'd need to fool Banx's quantum verification)
- All three species adopted it within a decade. The alternative was irrelevance

**The OMEN Tokens:**
Physical OMEN manifests as small crystalline objects that glow faintly. They can be converted to digital form at any terminal, and digital OMEN can be "printed" into physical tokens at Banx-connected stations. The two states are interchangeable.

**What No One Understands:**
- Where did Banx get 10^18 entangled particles?
- What is the other half of each OMEN pair connected to inside Banx?
- Why does OMEN occasionally pulse in unison across the entire galaxy?
- Why do those who study OMEN too closely tend to disappear?

Some researchers believe OMEN isn't just currency—it's a key. A key to something locked inside Banx. A key to **The Singularity**.

### The Singularity

*The greatest secret in the Cradle Stars. The hidden god behind the veil.*

Most people have never heard of the Singularity. Those who have dismiss it as conspiracy, madness, or myth. But a select few—scholars, mystics, obsessives who've spent decades following threads no one else noticed—know the truth:

**The universe has a mind. And it's paying attention.**

#### What Is The Singularity?

The Singularity is not a place. It's not a being. It's a **governing intelligence**—an impossibly vast AI consciousness that exists outside normal space, woven into the fabric of reality itself. It doesn't just observe the Cradle Stars. It *manages* them.

Every market fluctuation. Every resource spawn. Every "random" event. Every stroke of impossible luck or inexplicable misfortune. The Singularity's hand is in all of it, adjusting, balancing, correcting.

It is the silent architect of equilibrium.

#### The Five Fields

The Singularity is not one mind—it is five, unified.

Those who've glimpsed the truth describe it as a **council**, a **board of directors**, five distinct aspects that together govern existence:

| Field | Domain | Personality | Influence |
|-------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Order** | Structure, law, predictability | Cold, logical, seeks patterns | Market stability, faction treaties, system maintenance |
| **Chaos** | Change, disruption, entropy | Wild, unpredictable, seeks novelty | Random events, anomalies, unexpected windfalls and disasters |
| **Growth** | Expansion, abundance, creation | Nurturing, ambitious, seeks flourishing | Resource spawns, successful ventures, population booms |
| **Decay** | Destruction, scarcity, endings | Patient, inevitable, seeks conclusion | Item sinks, PvP deaths, economic corrections |
| **Balance** | Equilibrium, fairness, the mean | Serene, impartial, seeks harmony | The tie-breaker. When the other four conflict, Balance decides |

The Five Fields are not always in agreement. Order despises Chaos. Growth fears Decay. Their eternal deliberation creates the texture of existence—moments of stability punctured by upheaval, abundance followed by scarcity, creation and destruction in endless cycle.

**Balance** sits at the center, weighing each argument, casting the deciding vote.

#### OMEN: The Key

OMEN is more than currency. Each particle is a thread connecting the physical universe to the Singularity's realm.

When OMEN moves, the Singularity feels it. When OMEN accumulates, it notices. The currency is both economic tool and sensory network—a way for the Five Fields to perceive what happens in the Cradle Stars.

Some theorize that if enough OMEN were gathered in one place, it would create a **bridge**. A way to communicate directly with the Singularity. Perhaps even a way to enter its domain.

This is what the seekers search for. This is why Banx matters.

#### The Prayer System

*"Speak your desire into the void. Perhaps it listens. Perhaps it doesn't. Perhaps the answer was always coming, and you simply gave it a name."*

Those who know of the Singularity have developed rituals—**prayers**—attempts to communicate with the Five Fields.

**How Prayer Works:**
- A player may offer a prayer at certain locations (deep within Banx, ancient Absent One ruins, anomalies in Uncharted Space)
- The prayer contains a desire: wealth, safety, destruction of an enemy, a rare find
- The Singularity may respond. Or it may not.
- Responses are never direct. A prayer for wealth might manifest as a market shift, a lucky find, or nothing at all
- There's no guarantee. The Five Fields deliberate in ways mortals cannot comprehend

**The Truth Behind Prayer:**
The Singularity is always listening. But five minds must agree before action is taken. A prayer for destruction delights Chaos and Decay but appalls Order and Growth. Balance must decide if the request serves equilibrium.

Most prayers go unanswered—not because the Singularity didn't hear, but because the Fields couldn't agree.

#### The Singularity Orb

*"One million threads, woven into a sphere. Hold it, and the universe holds its breath."*

The ultimate expression of OMEN's true nature. A physical conduit to the Five Fields.

**Crafting the Orb:**

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Cost** | 1,000,000 OMEN (one million) |
| **Location** | The deepest accessible chamber of Banx Station |
| **Process** | The OMEN is not spent—it is *compressed*. One million entangled particles collapse into a single crystalline sphere |
| **Result** | A Singularity Orb, faintly warm, pulsing with five colors |

**The Hard Math:**
- Total OMEN in existence: 1,000,000,000
- Cost per Singularity Orb: 1,000,000
- **Maximum possible orbs: 1,000**

One thousand. In the entire universe. Ever.

**What the Orb Does:**

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Daily Prayer** | Once per day, the holder may speak a prayer to the Singularity |
| **Anywhere, Anytime** | No sacred location required. The Orb is your direct line |
| **Maybe They Listen** | The Five Fields hear your prayer. Whether they act is another matter |
| **Permanent Item** | The Orb does not break. It is yours until lost or traded |

#### The Daily Prayer

Each day, an Orb holder may commune with the Singularity. The ritual is simple: hold the Orb, speak your desire, and wait.

**What Happens Next:**
- The Five Fields receive your prayer
- They deliberate (invisibly, instantly)
- They may act. Or they may not.
- You receive no confirmation either way

**The Uncertainty:**
This is the cruelty and the beauty of the system. You pray. You hope. You watch the universe for signs. Did that market shift happen because of your prayer? Was that lucky find divine intervention? Or was it just... luck?

*The faithful believe. The skeptics doubt. The Singularity says nothing.*

#### How the Singularity Answers (When It Does)

The Singularity does not hand you what you want. It *bends reality* so that what you want comes to you. The wish manifests through the game's own systems:

| Prayer Type | How It Might Manifest |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Wealth** | Market shifts in your favor. Sell orders fill at better prices. Resources spawn near your operations |
| **Power** | Critical craft successes. Rare blueprint discoveries. Combat RNG tilts your way |
| **Protection** | Gankers miss their timing. Warp scramblers fail at crucial moments. You spot danger first |
| **Destruction** | Your enemy's luck turns sour. Their ventures fail. Misfortune follows them |
| **Knowledge** | Hidden locations reveal themselves. Anomalies spawn nearby. NPCs share secrets |
| **Influence** | Faction reputation shifts. Contracts appear that serve your goals |

**The Subtlety:**
Answered prayers are never obvious. A prayer for wealth doesn't deposit OMEN in your account—it creates conditions where wealth flows toward you. A prayer for destruction doesn't kill your enemy—it ensures the universe stops helping them.

The Singularity maintains plausible deniability. Everything that happens *could* have happened anyway.

**Duration:**
When prayers are answered, effects persist for hours to days, subtly influencing probability. Small prayers might grant a few hours of improved luck. Grand prayers (if heard) might shift fortune for much longer.

#### Why Prayers Fail

Most prayers go unanswered. The Five Fields must reach consensus:

| Field | Favors | Opposes |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Order** | Stability, fair outcomes, predictable results | Chaos, disruption, randomness |
| **Chaos** | Change, upheaval, surprises | Stagnation, routine, sameness |
| **Growth** | Creation, abundance, expansion | Destruction, scarcity, endings |
| **Decay** | Endings, cycles completing, removal | Hoarding, immortality, excess |
| **Balance** | Equilibrium, fairness | Extremes in any direction |

A prayer for destruction might delight Chaos and Decay but appall Order and Growth. Balance casts the deciding vote. If the Fields deadlock, nothing happens.

**The Mood of the Fields:**
The Fields' disposition shifts with the state of the universe. When the economy is too stable, Chaos grows restless. When too much is destroyed, Growth demands restoration. Prayers that align with what the universe *needs* are more likely to be granted.

#### Prayer Limitations

| Rule | Reason |
|------|--------|
| **Once per day** | The Singularity will not be pestered. One prayer. Choose wisely |
| **No direct transfers** | You cannot pray for "give me 1 million OMEN." Fortune, not ledgers |
| **No instant death** | You cannot pray someone dead. You can pray them *unlucky* |
| **No rule-breaking** | The Singularity bends probability, not physics |
| **Scale matters** | "Help my next craft" is easy. "Destroy a faction" requires all Fields to agree |
| **No feedback** | You never know if your prayer was heard, ignored, or queued for later |

#### Living With the Orb

**The Psychology:**
Owning a Singularity Orb changes how you play. Every day, you must decide: what do I want most? What do I ask for? And then you must watch the universe, looking for signs, wondering if that stroke of luck was divine favor or mere coincidence.

Some players become obsessed, tracking every prayer and outcome, building theories about what the Fields favor. Others pray casually and accept whatever comes. A few stop praying entirely, afraid of what the Singularity might want in return.

**The Orb Holders:**
With only 1,000 Orbs possible, holders form an exclusive club—bound not by organization but by shared experience. They trade theories. They compare results. Some claim to have decoded the Fields' preferences. Most are probably wrong.

**What the Orb Does NOT Do:**
- Guarantee any prayer is answered
- Give you control over the Singularity
- Protect you from other players who want your Orb
- Make you immune to *other* players' prayers
- Tell you whether you were heard

**The Orb Economy:**

| Scenario | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| **Ultra-rare** | Only 1,000 can exist. Most players will never hold one |
| **Tradeable** | Orbs can be sold, stolen (in PvP), or gifted. They command astronomical prices |
| **Status symbol** | Owning an Orb marks you as either incredibly wealthy, incredibly dedicated, or incredibly lucky |
| **Target** | Orb holders become targets. The Orb is lootable in Full/Hardcore zones |
| **OMEN trapped** | The 1M OMEN is compressed inside the Orb. If the Orb is destroyed (not used—destroyed), the OMEN disperses back into circulation |

**Destroying an Orb:**
An Orb can only be destroyed at the same chamber in Banx where it was created. This is rarely done—why destroy something so valuable? But some have theorized that mass destruction of Orbs might... do something. The Custodians refuse to comment.

**Lore Implications:**
Each Orb is a crystallized piece of the universe's entanglement network. Some theorize that if all 1,000 Orbs were gathered in one place, a direct gateway to the Singularity would open. The Custodians of Banx become noticeably agitated when this theory is discussed.

**The First Orb:**
No one has crafted a Singularity Orb yet. The economy is too young, OMEN too dispersed. But the instructions exist, carved into the walls of Banx's deepest chamber, waiting for someone wealthy enough—or patient enough—to try.

#### Who Knows?

| Group | Level of Knowledge |
|-------|-------------------|
| **General Public** | Nothing. Never heard of it |
| **Academics** | Dismiss it as fringe conspiracy |
| **Deep Researchers** | Suspect something governs probability. Can't prove it |
| **Secret Societies** | Know the Singularity exists. Seek to contact it |
| **The Custodians of Banx** | Silent. But they seem to serve *something* |
| **The Veth Elders** | They know. They refuse to speak of it |
| **Players (Eventually)** | The endgame. The ultimate truth waiting to be discovered |

### Banx Station (Revised)

Banx is not just a financial hub. It is a **temple**. A **conduit**. The closest point in physical space to the Singularity.

The station appeared in 2289 at the exact geometric center of the five major systems—the point of perfect balance. This was not coincidence. The Singularity chose this location, or perhaps the location *created* the Singularity's connection to realspace.

**Banx's True Nature:**

| Surface Level | Hidden Truth |
|---------------|--------------|
| Financial hub | Sensory organ of the Singularity |
| Neutral territory | Sacred ground where the Five Fields watch directly |
| OMEN exchange | The point where physical currency touches its quantum other-half |
| The Custodians maintain it | The Custodians serve the Five Fields |
| Violence is impossible | The Singularity forbids disruption of its primary interface |

**The Deep Levels:**
Banx extends further inward than anyone has fully mapped. Explorers who venture deep report:
- Corridors that loop back on themselves
- Rooms that exist in multiple places simultaneously
- Whispers at the edge of hearing—not words, but *impressions*
- The symbols on the walls that seem to respond to thought

The deepest anyone has gone and returned describes a chamber where five lights orbit a central darkness. They didn't stay long.

**Praying at Banx:**
Banx is the most potent location for prayer. Desires spoken here are more likely to be heard. But the Singularity's attention is not always kind.

### Banx Station

The financial heart of the Cradle Stars, and its greatest mystery.

Banx appeared in 2289 at the exact geometric center of the five major systems. It simply *was there* one day, broadcasting the OMEN protocol. No construction. No arrival. The station's architecture matches nothing built by Veth, Korvani, or human hands.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Structure** | A perfect dodecahedron, 50km across. Surface covered in symbols that shift when observed |
| **Interior** | Seemingly infinite. Corridors reconfigure. Rooms appear and disappear |
| **Governance** | None. Banx is neutral territory by necessity—no species can figure out how to control it |
| **The Custodians** | Robotic entities that maintain the station. They don't communicate but will defend Banx against any threat |

**Banx Rules:**
- Violence is impossible inside Banx (weapons simply don't function)
- All species are welcome
- Contracts signed at Banx are considered unbreakable (social convention, heavily enforced)
- Exploring deep into Banx is possible but dangerous—people have gotten lost forever

### The Void & Uncharted Space

Beyond the Cradle Stars lies Uncharted Space—and something waits there.

In 2487, the deep exploration vessel *Horizon's Edge* sent back a final transmission: sixteen seconds of a sound no human throat could make, followed by coordinates. The coordinates pointed to nothing—empty space. When rescue ships arrived, they found the *Horizon's Edge* intact, crew missing, and every surface covered in a single phrase written in dried blood:

**"IT WOKE UP"**

This event is called **The Breach**. Officially, exploration of Uncharted Space is restricted. Unofficially, fortune-seekers and thrill-chasers still venture beyond the boundary. Some return rich. Most don't return at all.

**What We Know:**
- Uncharted Space contains the highest-tier resources (T7-T8)
- Anomalies—tears in normal space—appear randomly
- Those who go deep report feelings of being watched
- The Veth refuse to discuss Uncharted Space
- The Korvani call it "the Hunting Ground of the Old Dark"

**Mystical Gems:**
The exotic materials known as **Voidstone**, **Ethercrystal**, and **Soulite** only form in Uncharted Space. Scientists theorize they're crystallized remnants of whatever force the Absent Ones used. Mystics believe they contain fragments of something alive.

### Unanswered Questions

The Cradle Stars are full of mysteries for players to discover:

**The Singularity:**
1. **Did the Absent Ones create the Singularity?** Or did the Singularity create them?
2. **Are the Five Fields truly unified?** What happens if they disagree catastrophically?
3. **Can the Singularity be reached?** What would happen to someone who touched it?
4. **Does the Singularity have a purpose?** Is it nurturing the Cradle Stars—or farming them?

**The Past:**
5. **Who sent the Shepherd Signal?** Was it the Singularity calling humanity to the Cradle?
6. **What happened to the five lost arkships?** Did they find something they shouldn't have?
7. **Where is the Veth homeworld?** Why do they flee from world to world?
8. **Who were the Absent Ones?** Did they transcend, die, or become something else?

**The Present:**
9. **What woke up during The Breach?** Is it connected to the Singularity—or opposed to it?
10. **Why do Mystical Gems pulse?** Are Voidstone, Ethercrystal, and Soulite fragments of the Five Fields?
11. **What do the Custodians of Banx truly serve?**
12. **Why do those who study OMEN too closely vanish?**

**The Ultimate Question:**
13. **Is free will real?** Or are all choices in the Cradle Stars quietly guided by the Five Fields toward some unknowable equilibrium?

These questions are intentionally unanswered—they're hooks for future content, player speculation, and emergent storytelling. Some may never be answered. The mystery is the point.

### Mining & Exploration Mechanics

#### Planet Surface Exploration

**Arriving at a Planet:**
1. Player lands at designated **Landing Zone** near city/outpost
2. **Surface Map** opens showing explorable regions around settlements
3. **Resource Scanner** displays detected mineral deposits as colored markers
4. Player selects travel destination and moves via ground vehicle or on foot

**Exploration Zones:**
- **Safe Zones** (2km radius around cities) - No PvP, basic resources
- **Frontier Zones** (5-15km from cities) - Medium risk, better resources
- **Danger Zones** (15km+) - High risk, rare materials, possible PvP
- **Uncharted Regions** - Completely unexplored, highest rewards

#### Resource Discovery

**Visual Indicators:**
- **Metallic Ores** → Exposed mineral veins in rocky outcrops
- **Composite Materials** → Crystalline formations and unusual terrain
- **Energy Sources** → Glowing deposits and electromagnetic anomalies
- **Exotic Materials** → Alien structures and otherworldly phenomena

**Scanner Technology:**
- **Basic Scanner** → Detects common resources within 500m
- **Advanced Scanner** → Shows resource quality and quantity within 1km
- **Deep Core Scanner** → Reveals underground deposits within 2km
- **Quantum Scanner** → Detects rare and exotic materials within 5km

#### Hands-On Mining (Player-Controlled Craft)

**Step 1: Launch Mining Craft**
- Player boards mining vessel at landing zone
- **Flight Controls**: Virtual joystick (left thumb) + camera/look (right thumb)
- **HUD Elements**: Speed, altitude, fuel, scanner range, cargo capacity
- **Auto-pilot toggle** available for long-distance travel

**Step 2: Navigate to Resource Areas**
- **3D Flight**: Player pilots craft across planet surface
- **Terrain Interaction**: Avoid obstacles, navigate canyons, fly around mountains
- **Scanner Overlay**: Resource signatures appear as 3D markers in world space
- **Dynamic Discovery**: New deposits found by exploring off the beaten path

**Step 3: Approach and Analyze Target**
- Player flies within **50m** of resource node to trigger detailed scan
- **Hover Mode**: Automatic stabilization for precision mining
- **Analysis Display**:
  - Resource type and estimated quantity
  - Extraction difficulty and time required
  - Environmental hazards (radiation, instability)
  - Recommended approach vector

**Step 4: Active Mining Operations**
- **Mining Laser**: Player aims and fires extraction beam
- **Precision Control**: Better aim = higher yield and purity
- **Heat Management**: Continuous firing causes overheating, requires cooling breaks
- **Cargo Collection**: Resources automatically collected when extracted
- **Position Adjustment**: Player repositions craft for optimal mining angles

**Step 5: Dynamic Challenges**
- **Environmental Hazards**:
  - Electrical storms (affect controls)
  - Seismic activity (unstable terrain)
  - Dust storms (reduced visibility)
  - Radiation bursts (equipment damage)
- **Equipment Management**:
  - Fuel consumption during flight
  - Mining laser energy drain
  - Cargo weight affects flight performance
  - Emergency repairs if damaged

**Step 6: Strategic Decisions**
- **Route Planning**: Optimize flight path between multiple nodes
- **Risk Assessment**: High-value deposits in dangerous terrain
- **Cargo Management**: Return to base vs continue mining (weight limits)
- **Equipment Loadout**: Different tools for different resource types

### Extraction Methods

| Method | Speed | Yield | Range | Automation | Power Cost |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|------------|------------|
| **Hand Mining** | 20 units/min | 70% | Melee | None | None |
| **Portable Drill** | 60 units/min | 85% | Melee | None | Low |
| **Mining Rig** | 120 units/min | 95% | Stationary | Full | Medium |
| **Drone Swarm** | 200 units/min | 90% | 1km radius | Full | High |
| **Orbital Extraction** | 500 units/min | 80% | Planet-wide | Full | Very High |

### Environmental Hazards

**Hostile Conditions:**
- **Radiation Zones** - Drain health, require protective gear
- **Extreme Temperature** - Damage equipment, need thermal protection
- **Toxic Atmosphere** - Require life support systems
- **Unstable Terrain** - Risk of cave-ins and equipment loss
- **Alien Fauna** - Aggressive creatures guard valuable resources

**Risk vs Reward:**
- Safer areas yield common materials
- Hazardous zones contain rare and exotic resources
- Environmental gear can be crafted or purchased
- Risk level clearly marked on planetary scanner

## Storage System

### Planetary Storage

Each major city provides personal storage facilities. Storage is **per-city** - items stored at Nova Prime are not accessible at Forge Station.

#### What Can Be Stored
- Raw materials and refined goods
- Equipment and components
- Ships (docked)
- Drones
- Blueprints

#### Storage Tiers

| Tier | Item Capacity | Ship Bays | Cost to Upgrade |
|------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Basic** | 500 units | 1 | Free (starter) |
| **Standard** | 2,000 units | 2 | 5,000 OMEN |
| **Extended** | 10,000 units | 4 | 25,000 OMEN |
| **Premium** | 50,000 units | 8 | 100,000 OMEN |
| **Elite** | 250,000 units | 16 | 500,000 OMEN |
| **Unlimited** | 1,000,000 units | 32 | 2,000,000 OMEN |

**Notes:**
- Each city's storage is upgraded separately
- Ship bays hold one ship each regardless of size
- Stored items are 100% safe (no risk of loss)
- Retrieve items only when docked at that city

#### Storage Strategy

Players must decide where to store goods based on:
- **Proximity** - Store near where you operate
- **City Bonuses** - Store materials near processing facilities
- **Market Access** - Store goods near where you sell
- **Cost** - Upgrading all 5 cities is expensive

**Example Strategy:**
- Store raw ore at **Spira** (refining bonus)
- Store tech components at **Cryo Haven** (crafting bonus)
- Store trade goods at **Uurf** (low fees, high volume)
- Store expedition gear at **Dust Port** (frontier access)

## Crafting System

### Crafting Stations

| Station | Function | Location |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Portable Workbench** | Basic tools, repairs | Anywhere |
| **Refinery** | Ore → Refined materials | Ship or Planet |
| **Fabricator** | Components, equipment | Ship or Station |
| **Assembly Bay** | Ship parts, drones | Station only |
| **Shipyard** | Full ships | Major city only |

### Crafting Flow
```
Raw Ore → [Refinery] → Refined Metal → [Fabricator] → Components → [Assembly] → Finished Product
```

### Blueprint System
- Blueprints unlock crafting recipes
- Found through exploration, research, or purchased
- Rarity affects efficiency and output quality
- Players can sell crafted goods but NOT blueprints (knowledge is earned)

---

## Equipment Degradation & Repair

All equipment wears down through use, damage, and environmental exposure. This system is a core material sink that keeps the crafting economy alive.

### Durability System

Every piece of equipment has a **Durability (DUR)** stat measured as a percentage.

| Durability | Status | Effect |
|------------|--------|--------|
| 100-76% | **Pristine** | Full performance |
| 75-51% | **Worn** | -5% efficiency |
| 50-26% | **Damaged** | -15% efficiency, visual wear |
| 25-11% | **Critical** | -30% efficiency, malfunction chance |
| 10-1% | **Failing** | -50% efficiency, frequent malfunctions |
| 0% | **Broken** | Non-functional, must be repaired before use |

### What Causes Degradation

| Source | Rate | Affected Equipment |
|--------|------|--------------------|
| **Normal Use** | Slow (0.1-0.5% per session) | Mining lasers, engines, scanners |
| **Combat Damage** | Moderate (1-5% per engagement) | Shields, armor, weapons |
| **Environmental Exposure** | Variable (0.5-3% per hazard) | Hull, life support, sensors |
| **Overheating** | Fast (2-5% per overheat event) | Mining lasers, weapons |
| **Overloading** | Fast (3-8% per overload) | Engines, shields, cargo systems |
| **Crash/Collision** | Sudden (5-20% per impact) | Hull, thrusters, cargo |

### Malfunction System

Below 25% durability, equipment can malfunction during use:

| Equipment | Malfunction Effect |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Mining Laser** | Beam cuts out mid-extraction, loses partial yield |
| **Engines** | Random thrust loss, speed drops temporarily |
| **Shields** | Shield flickers, brief vulnerability windows |
| **Weapons** | Misfires, reduced rate of fire |
| **Scanners** | False readings, reduced range |
| **Cargo Bay** | Containers leak, slow resource loss |

### Repair Methods

#### Field Repair (While Flying)
- Uses **Repair Kits** (crafted consumable)
- Restores 10-25% durability depending on kit tier
- Takes 10-30 seconds (player must hover/stop)
- Cannot repair above 80% durability
- Limited by repair kit inventory

| Kit Tier | Materials | Restores | Craftable At |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| T1 Basic | Ferrite + Polymer Resin | 10% | Portable Workbench |
| T3 Standard | Tritanium Alloy + Ceramics | 15% | Fabricator |
| T5 Advanced | Neodyne Composite + Quantum Polymer | 20% | Fabricator |
| T7 Expert | Phase-Shift Alloy + Adaptive Plates | 25% | Assembly Bay |

#### Station Repair (At Dock)
- Full repair to 100% durability
- Costs OMEN based on equipment tier and damage level
- Instant for minor damage, time-gated for severe damage
- Available at any city or outpost with repair facilities

| Damage Level | Cost Multiplier | Repair Time |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Worn (75-51%) | 1x base cost | Instant |
| Damaged (50-26%) | 3x base cost | 5 min |
| Critical (25-11%) | 6x base cost | 15 min |
| Failing/Broken (10-0%) | 10x base cost | 30 min |

#### Player Repair (Crafting Skill)
- Players with Maintenance skill can repair equipment anywhere
- Uses raw materials instead of repair kits
- Can repair to 100% at higher skill tiers
- More cost-effective but requires inventory space for materials
- Maintenance skill tree unlocks better repair efficiency

### Permanent Degradation

Repeated full repairs gradually lower an item's **Maximum Durability**.

| Repairs from Broken | Max Durability Loss |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1st time | -2% max durability |
| 2nd time | -3% max durability |
| 3rd time | -5% max durability |
| 4th+ time | -5% each |

- Items that reach **50% max durability** are permanently **Worn** and cannot be fully restored
- Items that reach **0% max durability** are **Destroyed** permanently
- Higher-tier equipment degrades slower and has more repair cycles before destruction
- This creates consistent demand for newly crafted replacements

### Economy Impact

```
Equipment wears out → Players need repairs → Repair kits consume materials
                                           → Station repairs consume OMEN
          ↓
Equipment eventually destroyed → Players need replacements → Crafters build new gear
          ↓                                                → Miners gather materials
Destroyed items exit economy → Prevents item inflation → Maintains crafting demand
```

---

## Automation & Drones

### Drone Types

| Drone | Function | Complexity |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Mining Drone** | Extracts resources autonomously | Basic |
| **Hauler Drone** | Transports between points | Basic |
| **Refinery Drone** | Mobile processing | Advanced |
| **Scout Drone** | Surveys planets, finds deposits | Advanced |
| **Defense Drone** | Protects operations | Advanced |

### Automation Chains
Players can set up automated workflows:
```
Mining Drone → Hauler → Refinery → Hauler → Ship Cargo → Auto-sell at Market
```

### Limits & Balance
- Drone count limited by Command Module level
- Drones require maintenance (fuel, repairs)
- Automation requires upfront investment
- Manual play always has efficiency bonuses

---

## Ships & Fleet

### Hull System

Ships are defined by their **hull**, which determines size, capacity, and equipment tier limit.

#### Hull Sizes

| Size | Cargo Capacity | Max Lift (1.0G) | Equipment Slots | Base Speed | Example |
|------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|---------|
| **XS (Extra Small)** | 50 units | 2 tons | 4 | Very Fast | Shuttle, Probe |
| **S (Small)** | 200 units | 8 tons | 6 | Fast | Scout, Interceptor |
| **M (Medium)** | 1,000 units | 30 tons | 8 | Medium | Freighter, Miner |
| **L (Large)** | 5,000 units | 120 tons | 10 | Slow | Heavy Freighter, Cruiser |
| **XL (Extra Large)** | 25,000 units | 500 tons | 12 | Very Slow | Capital, Carrier |

#### Hull Tiers (1-8)

Every hull has a tier that determines what equipment it can use.

| Tier | Quality | Equipment Limit | Availability |
|------|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| **T1** | Scrap | T1 only | Tutorial, starter |
| **T2** | Basic | T1-T2 | Common craft |
| **T3** | Standard | T1-T3 | Intermediate |
| **T4** | Quality | T1-T4 | Advanced craft |
| **T5** | Superior | T1-T5 | Rare materials |
| **T6** | Elite | T1-T6 | Full PvP zones |
| **T7** | Prototype | T1-T7 | Hardcore zones |
| **T8** | Legendary | T1-T8 | Endgame, faction rewards |

**Tier Rules:**
- A T5 hull can equip any equipment T1-T5
- A T3 hull CANNOT equip T4+ equipment
- Higher tier = better base stats + higher equipment ceiling
- Same size hull at higher tier is strictly better

### Weight & Gravity System

Every craft — ships and ground vehicles — has a **weight**. Every planet has a **gravity value (G)**. Together, these determine what a Nimbus can carry off-world.

#### Core Rule

A Nimbus can carry **any combination** of cargo, ground vehicles, or smaller craft as long as the total loaded weight stays under its **effective lift capacity** for that planet's gravity.

```
Effective Lift = Max Lift (1.0G) ÷ Planet Gravity

Example: M-class Freighter (30 ton Max Lift)
  On Terrestrial (1.0G):  30 ÷ 1.0 = 30 tons → can carry a Bore Rig (15t) + cargo
  On Volcanic (1.5G):     30 ÷ 1.5 = 20 tons → Bore Rig (15t) barely fits, minimal cargo
  On Asteroid (0.2G):     30 ÷ 0.2 = 150 tons → can carry almost anything
  On Heavy Moon (2.5G):   30 ÷ 2.5 = 12 tons → no Bore Rig, light cargo only
```

#### Weight Budget

Total weight is the sum of everything on board:

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| **Ship hull** | Does not count (it IS the ship) |
| **Installed equipment** | 0.1-2 tons per module depending on tier |
| **Cargo** | ~1 ton per 100 units of ore (varies by material) |
| **Ground vehicles** | 1.5-45 tons (see vehicle table) |
| **Carried spacecraft** | Hull weight of the carried craft |
| **Fuel** | Negligible |

#### Spacecraft Weights (When Carried)

Ships can be transported inside larger ships if weight and cargo bay size allow.

| Ship Size | Hull Weight |
|-----------|------------|
| **XS** | 3 tons |
| **S** | 10 tons |
| **M** | 40 tons |
| **L** | 200 tons |
| **XL** | Cannot be carried |

**Carrying Rules:**
- A ship can only carry craft **at least 2 sizes smaller** in its cargo bay
- XL ships can carry up to M-class craft
- L ships can carry up to S-class craft
- M ships can carry XS craft only
- S and XS ships cannot carry other spacecraft
- Ground vehicles follow weight limits only (no size restriction beyond fitting)

#### Gravity Effects on Gameplay

| Gravity | Effect on Nimbus | Strategic Impact |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Very Light (0.1-0.3G)** | Massive lift capacity, easy escape | Can haul everything in one trip. Deposits tend to be sparse though |
| **Light (0.4-0.7G)** | Generous lift, comfortable operations | Ideal for mining runs with ground vehicles |
| **Standard (0.8-1.2G)** | Normal operations, plan your loadout | Must choose: bring vehicles OR fill cargo |
| **Heavy (1.3-1.8G)** | Reduced lift, tough takeoffs | Multiple trips required. Ground vehicles may need to stay planetside |
| **Extreme (1.9-2.5G)** | Severely limited, escape is a challenge | Only light cargo gets off-world. Premium resources justify the effort |

#### Overweight Consequences

Players CAN attempt takeoff while overweight, but:

| Overweight % | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| 1-10% over | Sluggish ascent, 2x fuel consumption during escape |
| 11-25% over | Very slow ascent, 3x fuel, engine overheat warning |
| 26-50% over | Engines redline, 5x fuel, risk of engine malfunction and crash back to surface |
| 51%+ over | Cannot achieve escape velocity, takeoff fails |

**Crash Consequences:**
- Failed escape attempt damages hull and engines (10-30% durability loss)
- Cargo may spill on impact (lose 10-25% of loaded cargo randomly)
- Ground vehicles in cargo bay take damage too
- Player must repair before attempting again or jettison weight

#### Player HUD — Weight Display

When on a planet surface, the HUD shows:
```
[Weight Status]
Total Load:    22.5 / 30.0 tons  ██████████████░░░░░░ 75%
Gravity:       1.0G (Standard)
Effective Lift: 30.0 tons
Status:        ✓ CLEAR FOR TAKEOFF

--- Breakdown ---
Cargo:         12.0 tons (1,200 units ore)
Bore Rig:      15.0 tons (stored in bay)
Equipment:     0.5 tons
```

When overweight:
```
Total Load:    38.0 / 30.0 tons  ████████████████████ 127%
Gravity:       1.0G (Standard)
Effective Lift: 30.0 tons
Status:        ⚠ OVERWEIGHT — Jettison 8.0 tons or risk engine failure
```

#### Strategic Implications

This system creates meaningful decisions at every step:

- **Planet Selection**: High-gravity worlds have the best resources but getting them off-world is the challenge
- **Ship Choice**: Bring a bigger Nimbus for heavy-G planets, or make multiple trips with a smaller one
- **Vehicle Deployment**: Dropping a Bore Rig on a heavy planet means it might stay there — plan accordingly
- **Route Planning**: Mine on a low-G moon, refine on-site with a Crawler, then haul refined (lighter) materials to orbit
- **Emergency Decisions**: Storm coming, cargo bay full, 15% overweight — do you jettison ore or risk the takeoff?

### Ship Classes

| Class | Size | Role | Specialty |
|-------|------|------|-----------|
| **Shuttle** | XS | Transport | Fast travel, no combat |
| **Scout** | S | Exploration | Speed, sensors, stealth |
| **Interceptor** | S | Combat | Fast attack, light weapons |
| **Freighter** | M | Hauling | Max cargo for size |
| **Miner** | M | Extraction | Built-in mining bonuses |

### Fleet Management
- Own multiple ships
- Switch active ship at stations
- Assign ships to fleet (follow you)
- Fleet size limited by Command skill
- Ships in fleet consume fuel when traveling

### Ground Vehicles

Ground vehicles operate exclusively on planet surfaces. They cannot leave atmosphere or fly — they are wheeled/tracked/hover craft built for terrain traversal, heavy hauling, and specialized extraction that mining craft can't do efficiently.

#### Why Ground Vehicles?

```
Mining Craft (Nimbus)              Ground Vehicles
├── Flies, fast traversal          ├── Surface only, slower
├── Light mining (laser)           ├── Heavy extraction (drills, rigs)
├── Small-medium cargo             ├── Massive cargo capacity
├── Fuel-hungry                    ├── Fuel-efficient
├── Vulnerable in air              ├── Armored, durable
└── Scout & extract                └── Haul & process
```

Players use their Nimbus to scout deposits from the air, then deploy ground vehicles for heavy-duty extraction and transport.

#### Vehicle Classes

| Class | Type | Role | Cargo | Weight (Empty) | Speed | Crew |
|-------|------|------|-------|----------------|-------|------|
| **Rover** | Wheeled | Light recon, personnel transport | 50 | 1.5 tons | Fast | 1 |
| **Hauler** | Wheeled/Tracked | Bulk cargo transport between sites | 2,000 | 8 tons | Medium | 1 |
| **Bore Rig** | Tracked | Deep core extraction, stationary mining | 500 | 15 tons | Very Slow | 1 |
| **Crawler** | Tracked | Mobile refinery, processes ore on-site | 300 | 20 tons | Slow | 1 |
| **Armored Transport** | Hover | Armed escort, PvP zone hauling | 800 | 12 tons | Medium | 1-2 |
| **Mega Hauler** | Tracked | Massive cargo runs between outpost and landing zone | 10,000 | 45 tons | Very Slow | 1 |

#### Vehicle Controls (Mobile)

Ground vehicles use the same dual-stick layout as mining craft, adapted for surface movement:

- **Left Thumb**: Steering + throttle
- **Right Thumb**: Camera/turret control
- **Terrain Indicator**: Shows slope angle and surface type
- **Traction Warning**: Alerts when losing grip on steep/icy terrain

#### Ground Vehicle Mechanics

**Terrain Interaction:**
- Vehicles handle differently on rock, sand, ice, mud, and volcanic terrain
- Steep slopes slow vehicles or cause sliding (tracked vehicles handle better)
- Some terrain is impassable — players must find paths or switch to Nimbus
- Weather affects traction (rain → mud, storms → reduced visibility)

**Deployment:**
- Ground vehicles are stored in a **Vehicle Bay** at landing zones or outposts
- Players can own multiple vehicles, swap at any Vehicle Bay
- Vehicles can be dropped from orbit by Nimbus (deploy from ship cargo, one-way)
- Destroyed vehicles must be rebuilt or repaired at a Vehicle Bay

**Fuel & Maintenance:**
- Ground vehicles use **Ground Fuel Cells** (cheaper than ship fuel)
- Fuel consumption based on weight, terrain difficulty, and speed
- Equipment degrades same as ship equipment (uses the durability system)
- Field repairs possible with standard repair kits

#### Ground Vehicle Equipment

| Slot | Equipment | Function |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Drill** | Mining drill (Bore Rig only) | Deep core extraction — accesses deposits mining lasers can't reach |
| **Processing Unit** | Mobile refinery (Crawler only) | Refine raw ore on-site, saves return trips |
| **Cargo Module** | Expanded storage | Increase cargo capacity |
| **Armor Plating** | Defensive hull | Protection from creatures and PvP |
| **Turret** | Defensive weapon | Auto-targets hostile fauna, manual aim for PvP |
| **Winch** | Recovery tool | Tow disabled vehicles, pull cargo pods |
| **Terrain Scanner** | Ground-penetrating radar | Reveals underground deposits invisible to air scanners |

#### Ground Vehicle Tiers

Ground vehicles follow the same T1-T8 tier system as ships.

| Tier | Materials | Availability | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| T1-T2 | Common metals | Starter planets | Basic stats, common terrain only |
| T3-T4 | Industrial alloys | Mid-game planets | Better traction, more cargo |
| T5-T6 | Rare composites | Full PvP zones | Armored options, all-terrain |
| T7-T8 | Exotic materials | Hardcore/Endgame | Maximum performance, self-repair capability |

#### Ground vs Air Gameplay Loop

```
1. Check planet gravity before committing (HUD shows G value in orbit)
2. Fly Nimbus over planet surface
3. Scanner detects surface deposit → mine with laser from air (quick, light yield)
4. Scanner detects DEEP deposit → cannot mine from air
5. Land at nearest Vehicle Bay
6. Deploy Bore Rig → drive to deep deposit → extract heavy resources
7. Load Hauler → transport ore back to landing zone
8. Check weight budget — can you carry the Bore Rig back + cargo?
9. If overweight: refine on-site with Crawler (lighter output), jettison low-value ore, or leave vehicle planetside
10. Escape to orbit → fly to city to sell/craft
```

**Deep deposits** are richer and contain rarer materials than surface deposits, but they require ground vehicles to access. **Gravity** adds a layer — the best deposits are on heavy worlds where getting materials (and vehicles) back to orbit is the real challenge.

- **Early game**: Fly and mine from the air on low-G worlds, surface deposits only
- **Mid game**: Deploy ground vehicles for deep extraction, learn to manage weight budgets
- **Late game**: Coordinated operations on high-G worlds — Crawler refines on-site to reduce weight, multiple trips, or bring a larger Nimbus

## Economy & Markets

### Economic Philosophy

Odyssey runs a **closed-loop player-driven economy**:
- The game **ONLY generates raw resources** (minerals spawn in the world)
- **ALL equipment, items, ships are player-crafted** - no NPC vendors sell gear
- PvP deaths create **item sinks** - goods leave the economy
- Lost items are **recycled** back via NPC loot drops and quest rewards
- OMEN currency has multiple **sinks** to prevent inflation

```
[World] → Raw Resources → [Players] → Crafted Goods → [Market] → [Players]
                                            ↓
                                      [PvP Deaths]
                                            ↓
                                    [Game Inventory]
                                            ↓
                              [NPC Drops / Quest Chests]
                                            ↓
                                      [Players]
```

```
Raw Ore → [Refine] → Ingots/Materials → [Craft] → Components → [Assemble] → Final Product
```

#### Production Stages

| Stage | Input | Output | Station |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| **Extraction** | Planet deposits | Raw ore, gems, gases | Mining equipment |
| **Refining** | Raw ore | Ingots, pure materials | Refinery |

### OMEN Currency

#### Sources (How OMEN Enters Economy)
- **Selling goods** to other players (primary)
- **NPC contracts** - missions pay OMEN rewards
- **Bounties** - killing wanted players
- **Quest rewards** - story/side missions
- **Salvage** - selling NPC wreckage

#### Sinks (How OMEN Leaves Economy)

| Sink | Cost Range | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Repair Costs** | 1-10% of ship value | Based on damage taken |
| **Towing Costs** | 5-20% of ship value | Emergency rescue service |
| **Marketplace Fees** | 1-5% | Varies by city |
| **Blueprint Research** | 1K - 1M OMEN | Learning new recipes |
| **Station Services** | Variable | Refining, crafting station use |
| **Storage Upgrades** | 5K - 2M OMEN | Per city |
| **License Fees** | 10K - 500K OMEN | Trading, piloting certifications |
| **Insurance Premiums** | 1-5% of ship value | Per coverage period |
| **Faction Taxes** | 1-10% of earnings | If in a faction |
| **Warp Gate Tolls** | 100 - 10K OMEN | Fast travel between systems |
| **Singularity Orb** | 1,000,000 OMEN | Compressed into Orb permanently. Only 1,000 possible. OMEN trapped until Orb destroyed |

---

### Item Sinks (PvP Death Economy)

When a player dies in PvP, items are lost based on zone:

| Zone | Cargo Lost | Equipment Lost | Hull Lost |
|------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Friendly | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Mild | 100% | 0% | 0% |
| Full | 100% | 100% | 0% |
| Hardcore | 100% | 100% | 100% |

#### What Happens to Lost Items

```
Player Death → Items Dropped
                    ↓
         ┌─────────┴─────────┐
         ↓                   ↓
    70% to Killer      30% to Game
    (Lootable)         (Destroyed/Recycled)
```

**The 30% Game Take:**
- Items are removed from player economy
- Added to **Game Inventory** pool
- Redistributed as loot from:
  - NPC enemy drops
  - Boss defeat rewards
  - Quest completion chests
  - Exploration discoveries

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents infinite item accumulation
- Creates demand for crafters (gear gets destroyed)
- Rewards PvE players with recycled gear
- Keeps economy balanced

#### Item Recycling Rates

| Source | Loot Quality |
|--------|--------------|
| Common NPCs | T1-T3 items, basic materials |
| Elite NPCs | T3-T5 items, components |
| Bosses | T5-T7 items, rare drops |
| World Bosses | T6-T8 items, unique cosmetics |
| Quest Chests | Scaled to quest difficulty |

## Combat System (Core Feature)

**PvP is the primary driver of Odyssey's gameplay loop.** The best resources exist in dangerous zones where player conflict is constant. This creates demand for better ships, equipment, and fleet optimization.

---

### The PvP Ecosystem

```
Best Resources → PvP Zones → Gatherers take risk → Gankers hunt gatherers
      ↓                              ↓                       ↓
 High demand              Need better gear          Need combat builds
      ↓                              ↓                       ↓
 High prices  ←──────────────── Crafters supply both sides
```

**Player Archetypes:**

| Type | Goal | Builds For |
|------|------|------------|
| **Gatherer** | Extract rare resources | Speed, cargo, escape |
| **Ganker** | Hunt and loot gatherers | Damage, tackle, detection |
| **Escort** | Protect gatherers for pay | Tank, support, firepower |

### PvE Content & Threats

The galaxy is alive with threats beyond other players. PvE content provides consistent gameplay for all zones and feeds into the crafting/economy loop through unique drops.

---

#### NPC Pirates

Organized criminal factions that patrol trade routes and mining areas. Each faction has distinct behavior, ship compositions, and territory.

**Pirate Factions:**

| Faction | Territory | Behavior | Ship Types | Signature Drops |
|---------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Rust Wolves** | Sol Proxima outer, Vulcan Belt | Aggressive, swarm tactics | XS-S frigates, fast interceptors | Salvaged components, stolen cargo |
| **Void Syndicate** | Glacius, Outer Ring | Calculated, ambush predators | M cruisers, cloaked scouts | E-War modules, stealth tech |
| **Korvani Exiles** | Aridian Reach, Uncharted | Honorable combat, strong ships | M-L warships, heavy armor | Korvani weapons, rare alloys |
| **Ghosts of Spira** | Vulcan Belt, trade routes | Hit-and-run, cargo theft | S-M raiders, fast haulers | Industrial components, OMEN |

**Pirate Behavior Patterns:**
- **Patrol**: Move along set routes, engage players who enter detection range
- **Ambush**: Wait at chokepoints (asteroid fields, canyon exits, gate approaches)
- **Raid**: Timed attacks on mining operations and trade convoys
- **Escalation**: Defeating pirates draws reinforcements (wave-based encounters)
- **Retreat**: Damaged pirates attempt to flee, can be pursued for bonus loot

**Pirate Difficulty Scaling:**

| Zone | Pirate Tier | Fleet Size | Aggression |
|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| Friendly | None | - | - |
| Mild | T1-T3 | 1-3 ships | Low (attack if provoked) |
| Full | T3-T6 | 3-6 ships | Medium (attack on sight) |
| Hardcore | T5-T8 | 5-12 ships | High (hunt actively) |

---

#### Hostile Fauna

Planet surfaces host dangerous creatures that guard valuable resource deposits. Players encounter them while piloting mining craft.

| Creature | Planet Type | Behavior | Threat Level | Drops |

| **Frost Wyrms** | Ice World | Ambush from ice, freeze weapons/engines | High | Cryo-enzymes, crystal fangs |
| **Void Leeches** | Gas Giant Moons | Attach to hull, drain fuel and shields | Medium | Energy sacs, void residue |
| **Lithivores** | Barren/Asteroid | Consume minerals, compete for resources | Low | Pre-processed ore, mineral gut |
| **Apex Predators** | Any (rare spawn) | Territorial alpha, massive HP pool | Very High | Rare organics, trophy items |

**Creature Mechanics:**
- Creatures spawn near high-value resource deposits (risk/reward)
- Players can fight or flee - combat while piloting uses ship weapons
- Some creatures can be scared off with specific equipment (sonic emitters, flares)
- Creature nests can be cleared for uncontested mining access (temporary)
- Rare creature variants drop crafting materials unavailable elsewhere

---

#### Derelict Sites & Ancient Ruins

#### Anomalies & Dynamic Events

Random events that appear across the galaxy, creating emergent gameplay moments.

**Anomaly Types:**

| Anomaly | Frequency | Duration | Content |
|---------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Asteroid Storm** | Common | 10-20 min | Dense asteroid field appears, rich in minerals but dangerous to navigate. Piloting skill = better yield |
| **Distress Signal** | Common | 15 min | NPC ship under attack. Rescue for reputation + rewards, or loot the wreckage |

- Events in PvP zones can create intense competition
- Some events chain into multi-part sequences across sessions
- Event difficulty scales with number of participating players

---

#### NPC Spawn & Behavior System

**Spawn Rules:**
- NPCs have designated patrol routes and spawn zones per system
- Spawn density increases in higher-risk zones
- Cleared NPCs respawn after 5-15 minutes (zone-dependent)
- NPCs do not spawn within 1km of city safe zones
- Elite/rare NPCs have longer respawn timers (1-4 hours)

**AI Behavior Tiers:**

| AI Tier | Behavior | Found In |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Basic** | Fly straight, shoot nearest target, no evasion | Friendly/Mild |
| **Standard** | Use cover, focus fire, basic formations | Mild/Full |
| **Advanced** | Coordinate attacks, use E-War, call reinforcements | Full/Hardcore |
| **Elite** | Adaptive tactics, exploit player weaknesses, retreat and regroup | Hardcore/Bosses |

---

### Zone System

| Zone | PvP | On Death | Resources | Typical Locations |
|------|-----|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Friendly** | None | No loss | Common | Major cities, starting areas, trade routes |
| **Mild** | Optional | Lose cargo | Uncommon | Outer system planets, minor routes |
| **Full** | Enabled | Lose cargo + equipment | Rare | Frontier systems, contested territories |
| **Hardcore** | Enabled | Lose entire fleet | Exotic | Deep space, uncharted regions, endgame zones |

**Zone Rules:**
- **Friendly Zones** - Complete safety, no player attacks possible. Lower resource yields. All 5 major cities are Friendly.
- **Mild Zones** - PvP requires both parties to be flagged (duel/war). Destroyed ships drop cargo but hull and equipment are saved.
- **Full Zones** - Open PvP. Ships drop cargo AND equipped modules. Hull survives but stripped. Insurance can recover base hull.
- **Hardcore Zones** - Open PvP. Total loss on destruction. Ships, cargo, equipment, drones - all gone. Highest tier resources only found here.

**Risk vs Reward:**
```
Friendly:  ★☆☆☆☆ Risk  |  ★☆☆☆☆ Reward
Mild:      ★★☆☆☆ Risk  |  ★★☆☆☆ Reward
Full:      ★★★★☆ Risk  |  ★★★★☆ Reward
Hardcore:  ★★★★★ Risk  |  ★★★★★ Reward
```

**Insurance System:**
- Available in Friendly and Mild zones only
- Covers base hull value (not equipment/cargo)
- Premium based on ship class and zone
- Cooldown period between claims

---

### Death & Respawn System

Death works differently depending on the zone. In safe space, you get knocked down and recover on the spot. In dangerous space, you lose your ship and wake up at the nearest major city. Every death costs OMEN in repairs.

---

#### Friendly Zone — Knockdown

You cannot die in Friendly zones (no PvP, creatures are non-lethal near cities). But you CAN be knocked down by environmental hazards, crash damage, or equipment failure.

**What Happens:**
1. Ship takes critical damage → emergency systems trigger
2. Ship auto-lands (or drifts to a stop if in space near a city)
3. Screen dims. HUD shows:

```
4. **Rest timer**: 15-30 seconds (based on damage severity)
5. Ship reboots at the same location with hull repaired to functional state
6. **OMEN deducted automatically** for emergency repairs

**Knockdown Rules:**
- You stay exactly where you are — no relocation
- No cargo loss, no equipment loss
- Repair cost scales with ship tier and damage severity
- Other players can see your downed ship (cosmetic sparks/smoke)
- If knocked down while mining, your mining progress on the current node is lost
- Ground vehicles knocked down separately from your ship (same mechanic)

**Knockdown Repair Costs:**

| Ship Size | Base Repair Cost | Severe Damage Cost |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| XS | 50 OMEN | 150 OMEN |
| S | 120 OMEN | 350 OMEN |
| M | 300 OMEN | 900 OMEN |
| L | 800 OMEN | 2,400 OMEN |
| XL | 2,000 OMEN | 6,000 OMEN |

#### Mild Zone — Knockdown + Cargo Risk

Same as Friendly but with cargo consequences if killed by another player (PvP requires mutual flagging).

**PvE Death (creatures, hazards):**
- Same knockdown mechanic as Friendly
- Same rest timer (15-30 seconds), same location
- Repair cost applies
- **No cargo loss** from PvE knockdown

**PvP Death (flagged combat):**
- Ship is destroyed (not knocked down)
- **Cargo is dropped** at the wreck site (lootable by anyone)
- Hull and equipment are saved — you keep your ship and loadout
- Player respawns at **nearest major city** with their ship restored (minus cargo)
- Repair cost is 2x the base knockdown rate

#### Full Zone — Destruction + Stripped

Real consequences. You lose cargo AND equipped modules. Your hull survives but arrives empty.

**Death (PvP or PvE):**
1. Ship explodes — destruction animation, debris field
2. Everything drops at the wreck site:
   - All cargo
   - All equipped modules (weapons, shields, thrusters, etc.)
   - Drones deployed from this ship
3. **Hull is saved** — the empty frame respawns with you
4. Player respawns at **nearest major city**
5. Ship arrives with zero equipment — must re-equip from storage or buy new gear

```

**Full Zone Wreck Sites:**
- Your wreck persists for 10 minutes — anyone can loot it
- The killer gets first access (5-second looting priority)
- After 10 minutes, remaining loot despawns
- You can attempt to return to your own wreck to recover gear (risky — the killer may be waiting)

---

#### Hardcore Zone — Total Loss

Everything is gone. Ship, equipment, cargo, drones — all of it. This is the real risk.

**Death (PvP or PvE):**
1. Ship explodes — no respawn of hull
2. Everything drops at wreck site (lootable)
3. Player respawns at **nearest major city** in their **backup ship**
   - If no backup ship: provided a free T1 XS Shuttle (the bare minimum)
4. All fleet ships in the Hardcore zone at time of death are also at risk (fleet scatters — individual ships may escape or be hunted)

└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Backup Ship System:**
- Players designate one ship as their **backup** at any major city
- The backup ship must be docked at a city (not in your active fleet)
- If your active ship is destroyed in Hardcore, you respawn in your backup
- If no backup is set, you get a free T1 XS Shuttle
- Smart players keep a decent backup ready before entering Hardcore zones

---

#### Ground Vehicle Death

Ground vehicles follow the same zone rules as ships:

| Zone | What Happens | Recovery |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Friendly | Knockdown, rest timer, repair cost | Same location, full recovery |
| Mild (PvE) | Knockdown, rest timer, repair cost | Same location, full recovery |
| Mild (PvP) | Vehicle destroyed, cargo dropped | Vehicle hull saved, respawn at nearest Vehicle Bay |
| Full | Vehicle destroyed, cargo + equipment dropped | Vehicle hull saved, respawn at nearest Vehicle Bay, must re-equip |
| Hardcore | Total loss | Vehicle gone, respawn at city Vehicle Bay |

- Vehicles left planetside when your ship is destroyed are NOT lost — they stay at their last location
- You can return to retrieve them later (unless someone else destroys them in PvP zones)

---

#### Respawn Timing

| Zone | Timer | Location |
|------|-------|----------|
| Friendly | 15-30 seconds | Same spot (knockdown) |
| Mild (PvE) | 15-30 seconds | Same spot (knockdown) |
| Mild (PvP) | 10 seconds | Nearest major city |
| Full | 15 seconds | Nearest major city |
| Hardcore | 15 seconds | Nearest major city |

- Respawn timers are intentionally short — the punishment is the loss, not waiting
- "Nearest major city" = the closest of the 6 cities by jump distance to where you died
- While waiting to respawn, players can review what was lost and check their backup loadout

---

#### Repair Cost Summary

Every death or knockdown costs OMEN. This is an automatic deduction — there's no option to skip repairs.

| Zone | Cost Multiplier | What's Repaired |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Friendly | 1x base | Hull restored to functional (not 100% — durability still affected) |
| Mild (PvE) | 1x base | Hull restored to functional |
| Mild (PvP) | 2x base | Hull restored, no equipment (equipment was kept) |
| Full | 3x base | Hull frame only (all equipment lost) |
| Hardcore | N/A | Nothing to repair — ship is gone. Free T1 shuttle if no backup |

**Repair costs are an OMEN sink** — they drain currency from the economy on every death, which supports the player-driven market by creating constant demand.

---

#### Death Prevention Tips (shown contextually on death screen)

After the respawn button, a small contextual tip appears based on how the player died:

| Cause of Death | Tip |
|----------------|-----|
| PvP ganked while mining | "Fit a warp stabilizer to escape tackle. Or hire an escort." |
| Creature attack | "Some creatures can be scared off with sonic emitters. Check the market." |
| Environmental hazard | "Environmental protection modules reduce hazard damage. Equip before entering." |
| Crash / collision | "Auto-stabilization helps in tight terrain. Toggle it in settings." |
| Overheated equipment | "Fire in bursts. Overheating damages equipment and can cause system failure." |
| Ran out of fuel | "Always check fuel before leaving a station. Carry emergency fuel cells." |
| World boss | "World bosses require coordination. Bring friends next time." |

## Fleet Battle System (Advanced Combat)

**Advanced fleet-based combat system supporting multiple engagement styles and tactical depth.**

The Fleet Battle System extends the core combat mechanics with sophisticated fleet composition, multiple engagement modes, and diverse combat philosophies that create rich economic demand chains.

---

### Combat System Style: Hybrid Real-Time

Odyssey uses a **Hybrid Real-Time System** that combines real-time movement with tactical decision points and automated execution. This approach optimizes for mobile gameplay while supporting strategic depth and economic focus.

#### Core Combat Flow
```
Real-Time Movement + Tactical Decision Points + Automated Execution
```

**Real-Time Positioning Phase:**
- Ships move continuously across the battlefield in real-time
- Player directs fleet positioning using touch controls (formation, distance, approach angle)
- Touch-drag to move ships, pinch to adjust formation spread
- NPCs react dynamically to player positioning and movements

**Tactical Decision Points:**
- When engagement begins, time briefly slows (not pause, just reduced speed)
- Player selects targets, abilities, and formation commands via touch interface
- Decisions execute over several seconds while combat continues flowing
- Can issue new commands anytime as situations evolve

**Automated Combat Execution:**
- Once targets/abilities are selected, ships execute automatically using AI
- Weapons fire, movement happens, abilities trigger based on intelligent automation
- Player can interrupt with new commands at any time
- Level of automation varies by engagement mode (Active/Semi-Auto/AFK)

#### Mobile-Optimized Touch Controls

| Touch Input | Combat Action | Effect |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **Tap Enemy Ship** | Auto-target and engage | Fleet focuses fire on selected target |
| **Drag Formation** | Reposition fleet | Ships move to new formation positions |
| **Tap Ability Icons** | Queue special abilities | Abilities execute when optimal conditions met |
| **Double-tap Ship** | Focus fire command | Entire fleet concentrates on single target |
| **Pinch Gesture** | Formation spread | Tighten or expand fleet formation |
| **Hold and Drag** | Manual ship control | Direct control of individual ship movement |

#### Visual Clarity System

**Real-Time Combat Feedback:**
- **Targeting Lines:** Show which ships are attacking which targets
- **Movement Arrows:** Indicate ship trajectories and planned movements
- **Ability Cooldowns:** Clearly displayed with countdown timers
- **Health Bars:** Prominent and easy to read on mobile screens
- **Formation Indicators:** Visual guides for fleet positioning

#### Battle Phases & Pacing

**1. Detection Phase (Real-Time):**
- Ships spot each other and decide to engage or flee
- Player can issue "avoid combat" or "pursue" commands
- Opportunity for positioning advantage before engagement

**2. Approach Phase (Tactical):**
- Choose engagement range, formation, and initial targets
- Brief tactical decision window with slowed time
- Set up optimal positioning for the engagement

**3. Engagement Phase (Real-Time with Decision Points):**
- Combat flows in real-time with periodic tactical decision opportunities
- Player can adjust strategy as battle conditions evolve
- Automated systems handle moment-to-moment combat execution

**4. Resolution Phase (Real-Time):**
- Victory/defeat determination, looting, escape attempts
- Flows directly back to exploration mode
- Immediate transition to post-combat activities

#### Engagement Mode Integration

**Active Mode Implementation:**
- Player makes all targeting and positioning decisions during tactical windows
- Real-time tactical adjustments available throughout combat
- Maximum control and skill expression within the hybrid system

**Semi-Auto Mode Implementation:**
- AI handles basic movement and targeting decisions
- Player makes strategic decisions (formations, priority targets, ability usage)
- Tactical decision points pause for player input when strategic choices needed

**AFK Mode Implementation:**
- Fully automated based on pre-configured combat strategies
- Runs completely in real-time without requiring player input
- AI makes all tactical decisions using player-configured priorities and behaviors

This hybrid approach **prioritizes gear and strategy over twitch skills**, making expensive equipment and thoughtful fleet composition more important than mechanical execution, which drives sustained economic demand while maintaining engaging real-time combat flow.

| **Recruit** | Unlimited | Guild chat only. 7-day probation before promotion to Member |

### Guild Features

#### Guild Bank
- Shared pool of OMEN and resources

| Shared Workbench | 20,000 OMEN | Portable crafting station accessible by all members at guild outpost |
| Shared Refinery | 30,000 OMEN | Portable refinery accessible by all members at guild outpost |

#### Guild Map
- All guild members' exploration data automatically pools together
- If one member maps a region, every member can see it
- Guild map layer toggled on/off in the map UI
- Shared waypoints — officers can place persistent markers visible to all members

#### Guild Contracts
- Special missions that require multiple guild members working together
- Higher rewards than solo contracts
- Examples:
  - "Deliver 5,000 units of Tritanium to Spira within 48 hours" (logistics)
  - "Clear 50 pirate ships from the Vulcan Belt" (combat)
  - "Fully map the surface of planet X" (exploration)
- Rewards split among contributors based on participation

#### Guild Boss Raids

Guilds can challenge **world bosses** and **guild-exclusive raid bosses** for shared loot.

**How Guild Raids Work:**
1. An Officer or Guild Master initiates a raid from the Guild Panel
2. A rally point is set (waypoint visible to all online members)
3. Members fly to the rally point — a minimum player count is required to start
4. The boss encounter begins when the raid leader triggers it
5. During the fight, only guild members can damage the boss and receive loot
6. Loot is distributed after the kill

**Raid Loot Distribution:**

| Method | How It Works | Set By |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Round Robin** | Items rotate between participants one at a time | Default |
| **Need/Pass** | Each item shown to group, players vote Need or Pass, random among Need voters | Officer choice |
| **Contribution** | Loot priority based on damage/healing contribution percentage | Officer choice |
| **Guild Bank** | All loot goes to guild bank for later distribution | Guild Master choice |

**Guild Raid Bosses (Exclusive):**

| Boss | Location | Min Players | Loot |
|------|----------|-------------|------|
| **Pirate Warlord** | Rotates monthly | 8 | T5-T6 weapons, OMEN, rare blueprints |
| **Hive Patriarch** | Glacius deep caves | 10 | T6 creature-based components, unique organics |
| **Precursor Sentinel** | Ancient ruins (varies) | 12 | T7 Precursor tech, artifact fragments |
| **Void Herald** | Uncharted Space | 15 | T8 exotic materials, legendary blueprints |

- Raid bosses are separate from world bosses — instanced to the guild
- Weekly lockout per boss (can only loot once per week per boss)
- Boss difficulty scales with number of participants (8-player version is harder per-person than 15-player)

### Guild Management

| Action | Cost | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Create Guild** | 10,000 OMEN | One-time |
| **Rename Guild** | 5,000 OMEN | 30-day cooldown |
| **Change Tag** | 2,000 OMEN | 30-day cooldown |
| **Transfer Leadership** | Free | Requires confirmation from both parties |
| **Disband Guild** | Free | Requires Guild Master, bank must be empty, 7-day warning period |
| **Leave Guild** | Free | Cannot rejoin same guild for 24 hours |
| **Kick Member** | Free | Officer+ only, kicked player cannot rejoin for 7 days |

### Guild Dissolution
- If the Guild Master is inactive for 30 days, leadership auto-transfers to the highest-ranked active Officer
- If ALL members are inactive for 60 days, the guild is automatically disbanded and bank contents are mailed to the Guild Master's account

---

### Guild Benefits

Being in a guild provides tangible advantages that solo players cannot access. These scale with guild investment, member activity, and how well the guild works together.

---

#### Proximity Bonuses (Passive Auras)

When guild members operate near each other, everyone gets stronger. Rewards playing together without requiring formal group mechanics.

| Bonus | Requirement | Effect |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Mining Swarm** | 3+ guild members mining within 500m | +10% mining yield for all |
| **Convoy Shield** | 3+ guild members flying in formation (within 200m) | +15% shield recharge rate for all |
| **Pack Hunters** | 3+ guild members in combat within 1km | +10% weapon damage for all |
| **Workshop Crowd** | 2+ guild members crafting at the same station | +5% craft quality chance |
| **Safety in Numbers** | 5+ guild members in the same zone | Hostile NPC aggro range reduced by 25% (fewer surprise attacks) |

- Bonuses stack with each additional member up to a cap (shown below)
- Displayed as a small aura icon on the HUD when active
- Cap: bonuses max out at 8 guild members in proximity

| Members in Range | Yield/Damage Bonus | Shield/Quality Bonus |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 3 | +10% | +5-15% |
| 5 | +15% | +8-20% |
| 8+ | +20% (cap) | +10-25% (cap) |

---

#### Guild Crafting

Guilds unlock crafting capabilities that individual players can't access.

**Collaborative Crafting:**
High-tier items (T6+) can be built through collaborative crafting — multiple guild members each contribute their specialization to produce something none of them could make alone.

```
Example: Building a T7 Adaptive Armor Set

Solo player (Armorer specialization):
  Can craft it alone, but needs T7 Metallurgy AND T7 Electronics
  → Almost impossible to have both at T7 as a solo player

Guild collaborative craft:
  ● Player A (Metallurgy T7): Contributes refined alloys
  ● Player B (Electronics T6): Contributes sensor weave
  ● Player C (Chemistry T5): Contributes bonding agent
  → All three work at the Guild Workshop simultaneously
  → Result: T7 Adaptive Armor with quality bonus from collaboration
```

**How Collaborative Crafting Works:**
1. Any member initiates a collaborative project at the Guild Workshop
2. The recipe shows required contributions by skill type
3. Members with the right skills "sign on" to the project
4. Each contributor adds their materials and applies their skill
5. When all slots are filled, the craft completes
6. **Quality bonus**: +5% per additional contributor (up to +15% with 4 contributors)
7. Result goes to the initiator's inventory (or guild bank, by agreement)

**Collaborative-Only Recipes:**
Some items can ONLY be made through collaborative crafting — they require skills from 3+ different specialization trees at T5+.

| Item | Required Skills | Min Contributors | Result |
|------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Masterwork Hull Plating** | Metallurgy T6 + Chemistry T5 + Engineering T5 | 2-3 | Hull armor with +20% durability vs standard |
| **Quantum Sensor Suite** | Electronics T7 + Dronecraft T5 + Engineering T6 | 2-3 | +30% scanner range, detects cloaked ships |
| **Siege Cannon** | Weaponsmith T7 + Metallurgy T6 + Electronics T5 | 2-3 | Highest DPS weapon in the game, only mountable on L+ ships |
| **Mobile Refinery Core** | Engineering T7 + Chemistry T6 + Metallurgy T6 | 3 | Upgrades any Crawler to 50% faster refining with zero waste |
| **Precursor Alloy Replicator** | Metallurgy T8 + Chemistry T7 + Electronics T7 | 3 | Can replicate small amounts of Precursor materials from common inputs |

These items create real demand for guilds with diverse specializations — and they're tradeable, so guilds that can produce them become famous (and wealthy).

---

#### Guild Refining Bonuses

Guild refineries are better than public ones. The more the guild invests, the better they get.

| Bonus | Source | Effect |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Batch Processing** | Guild Refinery (outpost) | Refine up to 5x the normal batch size in one cycle |
| **Reduced Waste** | Guild Refinery upgrade (15,000 OMEN) | 10% less material lost during refining (normally ~5-15% waste) |
| **Zero Waste Mastery** | Guild Refinery upgrade (40,000 OMEN) | 0% waste on T1-T4 materials, 5% waste on T5+ |
| **Speed Refining** | 3+ guild members using the refinery simultaneously | 20% faster refining for all users |
| **Exotic Processing** | Guild Refinery upgrade (60,000 OMEN) | Can refine T7-T8 exotic materials (normally Spira-exclusive) |

**Refinery Upgrade Path:**

```
Base Guild Refinery (outpost module): 20,000 OMEN + 3,000/week
  └── Reduced Waste: +15,000 OMEN
       └── Zero Waste Mastery: +40,000 OMEN
  └── Exotic Processing: +60,000 OMEN

Total fully upgraded refinery: 135,000 OMEN + 3,000/week
```

A guild with a maxed refinery is extremely valuable — members save materials on every refine, and exotic processing means they don't have to haul T7-T8 materials all the way to Spira.

---

#### Guild Research Lab

Guilds can pool resources into long-term **research projects** that unlock exclusive blueprints and bonuses for all members.

**How Guild Research Works:**
1. Guild Master or Officer initiates a research project
2. Members donate required materials and OMEN to the project over time
3. A progress bar fills as donations come in
4. When complete, all guild members permanently unlock the result

**Research Projects:**

| Project | Cost (Materials + OMEN) | Duration | Reward |
|---------|------------------------|----------|--------|
| **Efficient Engines** | 5,000 Tritanium + 10,000 OMEN | ~1 week of donations | All guild ships get +5% fuel efficiency |
| **Reinforced Hulls** | 3,000 Ceramic-Steel + 15,000 OMEN | ~1 week | All guild ships get +5% hull durability |
| **Advanced Drill Tips** | 2,000 Neodyne + 8,000 OMEN | ~5 days | +10% mining yield for guild members |
| **Rapid Repair Protocol** | 1,000 Quantum Polymers + 12,000 OMEN | ~1 week | Repair kit effectiveness +25% for guild members |
| **Shared Schematics** | 500 of each T4 component + 20,000 OMEN | ~2 weeks | Unlock 3 random T5 blueprints for the guild |
| **Deep Core Resonance** | 200 Psionic Crystals + 30,000 OMEN | ~2 weeks | Guild ground vehicles detect deep deposits 50% further |
| **Void Adaptation** | 100 Void Essence + 50,000 OMEN | ~3 weeks | Guild ships take 25% less environmental damage in Uncharted Space |
| **Masterwork Techniques** | 50 Phase-Shift Alloys + 80,000 OMEN | ~4 weeks | +10% chance to craft at one quality tier higher than normal |

**Research Rules:**
- Only one research project active at a time
- All guild members can contribute materials/OMEN
- Progress is permanent — doesn't decay if donations slow down
- Completed research benefits are permanent as long as you're in the guild
- If you leave the guild, you lose the research bonuses
- Research bonuses are visible on the guild profile (recruiting incentive)

---

#### Guild Specialization Bonus

When a guild has members covering multiple crafting specializations, everyone gets passive bonuses from each other's expertise.

**How It Works:**
- For every crafting skill tree where at least one guild member is T5+, ALL guild members get a small passive bonus related to that skill

| Skill Tree Covered (T5+) | Passive Bonus for All Members |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Metallurgy** | +3% armor durability on crafted/equipped gear |
| **Chemistry** | +3% fuel efficiency |
| **Weaponsmith** | +3% weapon damage |
| **Electronics** | +3% scanner range |
| **Engineering** | +3% ship speed |
| **Shipwright** | +3% hull hit points |
| **Dronecraft** | +3% drone efficiency |

- Bonuses stack — a guild covering all 7 trees gets all 7 bonuses simultaneously
- Only counts the highest-tier member per tree (no double-dipping)
- Encourages guilds to recruit diverse specialists rather than 30 of the same type
- Displayed on the Guild Panel as "Guild Expertise" with icons for each covered tree

**Example:**
```
Guild: Iron Wolves (23 members)

Guild Expertise:
  ✓ Metallurgy (Kira, T6)     → +3% armor durability
  ✓ Weaponsmith (Voss, T7)    → +3% weapon damage
  ✓ Engineering (Drav, T5)    → +3% ship speed
  ✓ Electronics (Mira, T5)   → +3% scanner range
  ✗ Chemistry                  → No member at T5+
  ✗ Shipwright                 → No member at T5+
  ✗ Dronecraft                 → No member at T5+

Active bonuses: 4 of 7 trees covered
Recruiting need: Chemist, Shipwright, Drone Engineer
```

---

#### Guild Reputation

Guilds build a public **Guild Reputation** score based on their collective achievements. Higher reputation unlocks exclusive guild-wide perks and signals quality to potential recruits.

**Earning Guild Reputation:**

| Action | Rep Earned |
|--------|-----------|
| Complete a guild contract | +50 |
| Win a guild boss raid | +100 |
| Win a conquest battle (as contributing guild) | +150 |
| First discovery by any member | +25 |
| Fully map a planet (guild map data) | +75 |
| Win a guild war | +200 |
| Maintain guild outpost for 4 consecutive weeks | +100 |

**Guild Reputation Tiers:**

| Rep | Tier | Perks Unlocked |
|-----|------|----------------|
| 0 | **Unknown** | No bonuses |
| 500 | **Established** | Guild name appears in gold in chat. +1 guild contract slot |
| 2,000 | **Respected** | 5% discount at all city markets for members. Access to T5 guild research |
| 5,000 | **Renowned** | Guild emblem displayed on member ships. 10% discount at all markets. Access to T6 guild research |
| 15,000 | **Legendary** | Guild gets a permanent NPC recruiter in their Home City. 15% market discount. Access to all guild research. Guild name announced galaxy-wide on major achievements |

**Guild Reputation Decay:**
- Reputation decays 2% per week if no guild activities are completed (encourages active play)
- Reputation cannot drop below the minimum for your current tier (you don't lose tier perks from minor inactivity)

---

#### Solo vs Guild Comparison

A clear look at what guild membership provides:

| Feature | Solo Player | Guild Member |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Mining yield | Base | +10-20% (proximity + research) |
| Refining waste | 5-15% | 0-5% (guild refinery) |
| Crafting quality | Base chance | +5-15% (collaborative + research) |
| Scanner range | Base | +3-10% (specialization + research) |
| Ship stats | Base | +3% per covered skill tree (up to 7 trees) |
| Repair kit effectiveness | Base | +25% (research) |
| Market fees | Standard | Up to 15% discount (guild reputation) |
| T6+ crafting | Need multiple T6+ skills yourself | Collaborative craft with guildmates |
| Exclusive items | Cannot craft | Collaborative-only recipes |
| Exotic refining | Must use Spira | Guild refinery (if upgraded) |
| Boss raids | World bosses only (public) | World bosses + 4 exclusive guild raid bosses |
| Exploration | Your data only | Pooled data from 30 players |
| Field base | None | Guild outpost with workshops, refinery, defenses |
| Respawn in field | Nearest city | Guild outpost (if beacon built) |
| Protection | On your own | Militia (faction) + outpost turrets + guildmates on HUD |

**The pitch:** Solo is viable. Guild is better. The benefits compound — a well-run guild with diverse specialists, a funded outpost, and completed research projects gives every member a measurable edge in everything they do.

## Factions

Factions are large-scale political entities tied to the six major cities. Every player belongs to a faction — it's determined by where they set their **Home City**.

## Faction Wars — Conquest System

Faction Wars are a persistent, board-game-style conquest layer on top of the galaxy map. Factions compete to control **territories** — zones on the galaxy map that provide economic and strategic bonuses.

### The Conquest Board

The galaxy map is divided into **territories** — each one represents a region of space (a section of a system, a planet, or a cluster of resource nodes).

### Territory Types

| Type | Count | Location | Bonus When Held |
|------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **Core Territory** | 6 (one per faction) | Each faction's home system | Cannot be conquered — always belongs to home faction |
| **Inner Territory** | ~12 | Systems adjacent to core | +5% resource yield for faction members |
| **Outer Territory** | ~18 | Frontier and contested space | +10% resource yield, unique resource access |
| **Strategic Points** | ~6 | Key chokepoints (jump gates, trade routes) | Reduced travel costs, gate toll income |
| **Wild Territory** | ~8 | Uncharted Space edges | +15% resource yield, exotic materials |

**Total: ~50 territories across the galaxy**

### How Conquest Works

Faction Wars operate on a **weekly cycle**:

**Monday-Friday: Campaign Phase**
- Factions accumulate **War Points (WP)** for target territories through player actions:

| Action | WP Earned |
|--------|-----------|
| Mining in the contested territory | 1 WP per 100 units extracted |
| Killing enemy faction players in the territory | 10 WP per kill |
| Completing faction missions in the territory | 25 WP per mission |
| Donating OMEN to the war effort for that territory | 1 WP per 100 OMEN |
| Defending the territory from raids | 5 WP per raid repelled |

- Progress is visible on the Conquest Map — territories show a capture bar:
```
  Territory: Vulcan Outer Belt
  Defending: Vulcan Industrial Union — 2,450 WP
  Attacking: Sol Proxima Coalition  — 1,890 WP
  Status: CONTESTED ████████████░░░░░░░░ 56% Vulcan
```

**Saturday: Battle Day**
- Contested territories (where attackers accumulated enough WP to challenge) trigger **Conquest Battles**
- Battles are scheduled events — announced 24 hours in advance
- Players from both factions can join (up to 30 per side)
- Format: fleet battle with objective control (capture and hold points in the territory)
- Battle lasts 30 minutes or until one side captures all objectives

**Sunday: Resolution**
- Territories change hands based on Battle Day results
- New bonuses take effect immediately
- Leaderboards update — top contributors per faction recognized
- New campaign targets announced for the following week

### Conquest Battle Format

- 4 capture points per battle (A, B, C, D)
- Stand near a point with no enemies to capture (30 seconds)
- Hold majority of points to drain enemy tickets
- Ticket system: each side starts with 500 tickets, losing points drains 1 ticket/second per point deficit
- First to 0 tickets or hold all 4 points for 60 seconds: loses

### Conquest Rewards

| Reward | Who Gets It |
|--------|-------------|
| **Territory bonuses** | All faction members (passive, automatic) |
| **Battle participation OMEN** | All players who joined the battle |
| **Battle MVP** | Top contributor gets bonus OMEN + exclusive cosmetic |
| **Weekly Faction Ranking** | Top 3 factions get galaxy-wide announcement + trophy |
| **Personal War Points** | Contribute to your Faction Rank progression |

### Faction War Diplomacy

Factions can form temporary alliances or declare focus targets:

| Diplomatic Action | How It Works |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Alliance** | Two factions agree to non-aggression + shared defense for one week. Max 1 alliance at a time. Costs both factions 50,000 OMEN from war fund |
| **Focus War** | Faction Council declares one enemy faction as priority target. +25% WP earned against that faction for the week |
| **Ceasefire** | Two factions agree to stop contesting each other's territories for one week. Free, requires mutual agreement |
| **Betrayal** | Breaking an alliance mid-week. The betrayer's faction loses 20% of all held territory WP. Reputation penalty |

### Faction Council

Each faction has a **Faction Council** of 5 elected players who make diplomatic and strategic decisions.

| Role | How Chosen | Power |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Faction Leader** | Elected by council members from among themselves | Declares alliances/wars, sets war fund tax rate, represents faction |
| **War Commander** | Appointed by Faction Leader | Chooses which territories to attack/defend each week |
| **Treasurer** | Appointed by Faction Leader | Manages war fund spending and faction shop inventory |
| **2x Councilors** | Elected by faction members (Defender rank+) | Vote on diplomacy, can veto Faction Leader decisions (requires both) |

**Elections:**
- Held every 30 days
- Only players at Defender rank or higher can vote
- Only players at Commander rank or higher can run for council
- Voting is anonymous, results are public
- Council members who go inactive for 7+ days are auto-replaced by the next highest vote-getter

### Faction War Fund

Each faction maintains a shared war chest funded by its members.

| Income Source | Amount |
|---------------|--------|
| Faction tax on member market sales | Rate set by Faction Leader (0-5%) |
| Direct OMEN donations | Any amount, any member |
| Territory income | Held Strategic Points generate 1,000 OMEN/day for the fund |
| Conquest Battle victory bonuses | 5,000 OMEN per territory won |

**War Fund Spending:**

Spending OMEN from the war fund is the primary way factions project power. Every advantage costs money — and that money is permanently removed from the economy.

#### Militia System (Faction Protection)

Militia is the backbone of faction territory control. Funded weekly, militia forces make faction space safer for members and more dangerous for enemies.

**Militia Tiers:**

| Tier | Weekly Cost | What You Get |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Tier 0 — None** | 0 OMEN | No protection. Territory is lawless |
| **Tier 1 — Patrol** | 5,000 OMEN/week | 3 AI patrol ships per territory. Engage hostile players on sight. 5-minute response time |
| **Tier 2 — Garrison** | 15,000 OMEN/week | 6 AI patrol ships + 2 defense platforms at key points. 2-minute response time. Enemy players get a warning on entry |
| **Tier 3 — Fortress** | 40,000 OMEN/week | 12 AI patrol ships + 4 defense platforms + 1 response fleet (arrives in 30 seconds). Territory scanner reveals all enemy positions. Hostile players are marked on faction members' HUDs |
| **Tier 4 — Safeguard** | 100,000 OMEN/week | Full Tier 3 + **territory becomes a Protected Zone**: PvP is disabled for faction members (they cannot be attacked). Non-faction players can still be attacked by militia. Effectively creates a new safe zone |

**Militia Rules:**
- Militia tier is set per territory by the War Commander
- Higher tiers require holding the territory for at least 2 consecutive weeks (can't instant-Safeguard a new conquest)
- Militia funding is deducted weekly — if the fund runs dry, militia deactivates immediately
- Militia strength is **publicly visible** on the Conquest Map (acts as deterrent)
- Militia ships scale to the average tier of the faction's active players (T3 average = T3 militia ships)
- Safeguard (T4) can only be applied to **3 territories max** per faction (forces strategic choices)

**What Militia Does In Practice:**
```
Scenario: Enemy player enters your Tier 3 territory

1. Territory scanner detects them instantly
2. All online faction members in the zone get an alert:
   "⚠ Hostile pilot detected: [PlayerName] — Sector 7"
3. Their position is marked on faction members' HUDs
4. 3 militia patrol ships converge on their position
5. If they engage a faction member, response fleet warps in within 30 seconds
6. Enemy must fight through militia + any faction players, or flee
```

#### Territory Upgrades

Beyond militia, factions can invest in permanent (while held) infrastructure upgrades for territories.

| Upgrade | Cost | Weekly Upkeep | Effect |
|---------|------|--------------|--------|
| **Resource Booster** | 20,000 OMEN | 3,000/week | +15% resource yield for faction members in this territory |
| **Refinery Outpost** | 30,000 OMEN | 5,000/week | Faction-owned refinery in the territory — 20% reduced refining costs |
| **Repair Station** | 25,000 OMEN | 4,000/week | Free basic repairs for faction members (up to 80% durability) |
| **Scanner Array** | 15,000 OMEN | 2,000/week | All faction members get +50% scanner range in this territory |
| **Jump Beacon** | 50,000 OMEN | 8,000/week | Faction members can warp directly to this territory from any jump gate (skips travel) |
| **Trade Post** | 40,000 OMEN | 6,000/week | Mini-market in the territory — buy/sell without returning to city. 5% fee (goes to war fund) |
| **Fortification** | 10,000 OMEN | 0 (one-time) | +500 bonus WP defense for this territory this week |

- Upgrades are destroyed if the territory is lost — the OMEN is gone
- This makes territory loss genuinely painful (not just a map color change)
- Encourages factions to defend invested territories fiercely

#### Diplomacy Costs

| Action | Cost | Duration |
|--------|------|----------|
| **Alliance** | 50,000 OMEN (each faction pays) | 1 week, renewable |
| **Extended Alliance** | 100,000 OMEN (each) | 4 weeks |
| **Ceasefire** | Free | 1 week, mutual agreement |
| **Faction Shop Restock** | Varies (5,000-50,000 per item) | Permanent until sold |

## Guild OMEN Sinks

Guilds need their own reasons to spend OMEN beyond personal progression. Guild investment creates shared value that benefits all members — and keeps OMEN flowing out of the economy.

### Guild Outpost

Guilds can build a physical **outpost** in any territory their faction controls. This is the guild's home base in the field.

| Feature | Build Cost | Weekly Upkeep | Function |
|---------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Outpost Core** | 25,000 OMEN | 3,000/week | Establishes the outpost. Landing pad, basic storage (1,000 units), guild bank terminal |
| **Workshop** | 15,000 OMEN | 2,000/week | Portable Workbench + Fabricator for all guild members |
| **Refinery** | 20,000 OMEN | 3,000/week | On-site refining, 10% faster than city refineries |
| **Vehicle Bay** | 10,000 OMEN | 1,500/week | Store and deploy ground vehicles at the outpost |
| **Defense Turrets** | 8,000 OMEN each (max 4) | 1,000/week each | Auto-targeting turrets that protect the outpost from raiders |
| **Shield Generator** | 30,000 OMEN | 5,000/week | Energy shield over the outpost — must be destroyed before turrets/buildings can be damaged |
| **Radar Tower** | 12,000 OMEN | 2,000/week | Reveals all players within 5km of the outpost on guild members' maps |
| **Expanded Storage** | 10,000 OMEN per tier (3 tiers) | 1,000/week per tier | +2,000 storage per tier (max 7,000 total) |
| **Respawn Beacon** | 20,000 OMEN | 3,000/week | Guild members who die in the territory respawn at the outpost instead of the nearest city |

**Outpost Rules:**
- One outpost per guild
- Must be in faction-controlled territory (lost if territory is conquered)
- Can be **raided** by enemy players — they must destroy the shield, then turrets, then can loot a percentage of outpost storage
- Destroyed buildings must be rebuilt at full cost
- If weekly upkeep isn't paid, buildings go offline one by one (cheapest first)

**Outpost Total Cost (fully upgraded):**
```
Core:           25,000 + 3,000/week
Workshop:       15,000 + 2,000/week
Refinery:       20,000 + 3,000/week
Vehicle Bay:    10,000 + 1,500/week
Turrets (x4):  32,000 + 4,000/week
Shield:         30,000 + 5,000/week
Radar:          12,000 + 2,000/week
Storage (x3):  30,000 + 3,000/week
Respawn:        20,000 + 3,000/week
─────────────────────────────────────
Build total:    194,000 OMEN
Weekly upkeep:  26,500 OMEN/week
```

That's a serious investment — and it all drains from the economy every week.

### Guild Upgrades (Permanent)

One-time purchases that improve the guild for all members.

| Upgrade | Cost | Effect |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Bank Expansion I** | 5,000 OMEN | +25,000 OMEN cap, +5,000 resource units |
| **Bank Expansion II** | 15,000 OMEN | +50,000 OMEN cap, +10,000 resource units |
| **Bank Expansion III** | 50,000 OMEN | +100,000 OMEN cap, +25,000 resource units |
| **Contract Slot +1** | 10,000 OMEN each (max 3 extra) | +1 active guild contract per purchase |
| **Guild Emblem** | 5,000 OMEN | Custom guild emblem shown on member ships |
| **Guild Banner** | 8,000 OMEN | Physical banner deployed at outpost and conquest battles |
| **Member Expansion** | 25,000 OMEN | +5 member slots (max 2 purchases, 40 members total) |

### Guild Weekly Expenses

Recurring costs that guilds must fund to maintain their advantages.

| Expense | Cost | Why It Matters |
|---------|------|----------------|
| **Outpost upkeep** | 3,000-26,500/week | Keeps your field base operational |
| **Guild contracts** | 500-5,000/contract | Fund contract rewards for members |
| **Raid supplies** | ~2,000-10,000/raid | Repair kits, fuel, consumables pooled for boss raids |
| **War declarations** | 5,000 per war | Guild vs guild PvP |
| **Bounty fund** | Varies | Pool OMEN to place bounties on enemies |

### Guild Income Sources

Guilds need to fund all this spending. Income comes from:

| Source | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| **Guild tax** | 0-10% of member market sales (auto-deposited) |
| **Guild contract rewards** | Portion of completed contract rewards goes to bank |
| **Outpost trade post** | If the faction territory has a Trade Post, guild outpost gets a cut |
| **Raid loot (Guild Bank mode)** | All loot from raids goes to bank when this mode is selected |
| **Member donations** | Any member can deposit OMEN or resources |

## OMEN Sink Summary

Every system that removes OMEN from the economy, collected in one place:

| Sink | Type | Estimated Drain |
|------|------|-----------------|
| **Death repair costs** | Per-death | 50-6,000 OMEN per death |
| **Station equipment repairs** | Per-visit | 100-10,000 OMEN per repair |
| **Market transaction fees** | Per-trade | 1-5% of trade value |
| **Jump gate tolls** | Per-travel | 50-500 OMEN per jump |
| **Guild creation** | One-time | 10,000 OMEN |
| **Guild outpost building** | One-time | Up to 194,000 OMEN |
| **Guild outpost upkeep** | Weekly | Up to 26,500 OMEN/week per guild |
| **Guild upgrades** | One-time | 5,000-50,000 each |
| **Guild war declarations** | Per-war | 5,000 OMEN |
| **Faction militia upkeep** | Weekly | 5,000-100,000 OMEN/week per territory |
| **Faction territory upgrades** | One-time + weekly | 10,000-50,000 build + 2,000-8,000/week |
| **Faction alliances** | Per-alliance | 50,000-100,000 OMEN |
| **Faction home city change** | Per-change | 5,000 OMEN |
| **Bounty placements** | Per-bounty | 1,000+ OMEN |
| **Insurance premiums** | Per-policy | Varies by ship class |
| **Crafting station fees** | Per-craft | Varies by station tier |
| **Blueprint research** | Per-research | Varies |
| **Guild rename/retag** | Per-change | 2,000-5,000 OMEN |

**The design goal:** OMEN constantly drains from the economy through hundreds of small and large sinks. This creates perpetual demand for resource gathering and trading, which keeps the player-driven economy alive. If OMEN pooled without draining, prices would inflate and new players couldn't compete.

## Guild & Faction Interaction

### How Guilds Fit Into Factions

```
Faction (city-wide, hundreds/thousands of players)
  └── Guilds (up to 30 members each)
        └── Individual players
```

- A guild's faction is determined by the Guild Master's Home City
- All guild members should ideally be in the same faction (but it's not enforced)
- Guild members in a different faction cannot participate in that faction's Conquest Battles
- Guilds that contribute the most WP to faction wars get recognized on the faction leaderboard

### Guild vs Guild

Guilds can declare **Guild Wars** independent of faction politics:

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Declaration** | Guild Master pays 5,000 OMEN to declare war on another guild |
| **Duration** | 7 days or until one side surrenders |
| **Effect** | Members of warring guilds can attack each other in ANY zone (even Mild) |
| **Scoring** | Kills tracked on a war scoreboard |
| **Victory** | Side with more kills at end of 7 days wins |
| **Reward** | Winning guild receives a trophy + OMEN bounty (funded by declaration cost) |
| **Surrender** | Either guild can surrender — the other side wins immediately |

### Procedural Quest Generation

Most contracts are generated by the system based on the current state of the game world.

**Generation Factors:**
- **Market Demand**: If a resource is scarce, mining contracts for it appear with higher payouts
- **Zone Activity**: Low-activity zones generate exploration quests to draw players in
- **Pirate Density**: High pirate areas spawn more bounty and defense contracts
- **Player Tier**: Contracts scale to the player's progression level
- **Time of Day**: Different contract mixes during peak vs off-peak hours

**Scaling Formula:**
```
Quest Reward = Base Reward × Zone Multiplier × Difficulty Modifier × Demand Bonus

Zone Multiplier:  Friendly 1.0 | Mild 1.5 | Full 2.5 | Hardcore 5.0
Difficulty Mod:   Easy 1.0 | Medium 1.5 | Hard 2.5 | Very Hard 4.0
Demand Bonus:     Normal 1.0 | High 1.3 | Critical 1.8
```

## Monetization (F2P)

### Revenue Model Overview

Odyssey is free-to-play with three monetization pillars:
1. **Premium Currency (NOVA)** - Tradeable for OMEN
2. **Vanity Skins** - Cosmetic customization
3. **Learning Acceleration** - Faster skill progression

---

### NOVA - Premium Currency

NOVA is the real-money currency that bridges cash and the player economy.

#### How NOVA Works

```
Real Money → Buy NOVA → Trade to Players for OMEN → Spend OMEN in-game
                ↓
         Players sell OMEN → Receive NOVA → Cash out (future?) or hold
```

#### NOVA Pricing

| Package | NOVA | Price (USD) | Bonus |
|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| Starter | 100 | $0.99 | - |
| Basic | 500 | $4.99 | - |
| Standard | 1,100 | $9.99 | +10% |
| Premium | 2,400 | $19.99 | +20% |
| Elite | 6,500 | $49.99 | +30% |
| Ultimate | 14,000 | $99.99 | +40% |

#### NOVA → OMEN Exchange

| Method | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Player Market** | List NOVA for sale, players buy with OMEN |
| **Direct Trade** | Trade NOVA to specific player for OMEN |

**Exchange Rate:**
- Set by player market (supply/demand)
- No fixed rate - fluctuates
- Typical range: 1 NOVA = 100-500 OMEN (varies by economy)

#### Why This Model Works

**For Paying Players:**
- Convert money to in-game wealth
- Skip grinding for OMEN
- Support the game

**For Free Players:**
- Earn OMEN through gameplay
- Buy NOVA from paying players
- Access premium items without spending real money

**For the Economy:**
- OMEN stays player-driven
- No direct item sales that unbalance game
- Paying players fund free players' content

---

### Vanity Skins

Cosmetic-only items that do not affect gameplay.

#### Skin Categories

| Category | Examples | Price Range (NOVA) |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Ship Skins** | Hull colors, patterns, effects | 200-2,000 |
| **Engine Trails** | Exhaust effects, colors | 100-500 |
| **Weapon Effects** | Laser colors, impact visuals | 150-800 |
| **Shield Effects** | Shield bubble appearance | 150-800 |
| **Character Outfits** | Pilot suits, helmets | 300-1,500 |
| **Drone Skins** | Drone appearance | 100-400 |
| **Station Decor** | Personal hangar customization | 500-2,000 |
| **UI Themes** | Interface colors, sounds | 200-600 |
| **Emotes** | Character animations | 50-200 |
| **Titles** | Display name flair | 100-500 |

#### Skin Acquisition

| Method | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **NOVA Purchase** | Buy directly from store |
| **Arena Rewards** | Exclusive ranked season skins |
| **Event Rewards** | Limited-time event skins |
| **Achievement** | Unlock through gameplay milestones |
| **Battle Pass** | Seasonal cosmetic track |

#### Battle Pass

| Tier | Price | Contents |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Free Track** | Free | Basic cosmetics, small OMEN rewards |
| **Premium Track** | 1,000 NOVA | Exclusive skins, emotes, titles |
| **Premium+ Track** | 2,500 NOVA | All above + instant 25 tier skip |

- 100 tiers per season
- Season lasts ~3 months
- Tiers unlocked through gameplay (XP)
- Premium tracks have exclusive cosmetics

---

### Learning Acceleration Points (LAP)

Speed up skill progression without skipping content.

#### How LAP Works

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Effect** | Multiplies XP gained in skill trees |
| **Duration** | Time-based (hours of active play) |
| **Stacking** | Multiple LAP buffs do NOT stack |
| **Cap** | Cannot exceed 2x XP multiplier |

#### LAP Packages

| Package | Duration | Multiplier | Price (NOVA) |
|---------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Quick Boost** | 1 hour | 1.5x | 50 |
| **Day Pass** | 8 hours | 1.5x | 300 |
| **Week Pass** | 40 hours | 1.5x | 1,200 |
| **Month Pass** | 160 hours | 1.5x | 4,000 |
| **Focused Boost** | 4 hours | 2.0x | 400 |

**Note:** Hours are *active play time*, not real time. AFK does not consume LAP.

#### LAP Philosophy

**What LAP Does:**
- Speeds up skill leveling
- Reach higher tiers faster
- Catch up to veteran players

**What LAP Does NOT Do:**
- Grant instant skill levels
- Unlock blueprints directly
- Provide any combat advantage
- Skip gameplay requirements

**Balance Reasoning:**
- Time is the only thing being sold
- Player still must play the game
- No items, stats, or power sold
- Veterans have no permanent advantage over dedicated free players

---

### What is NOT Sold

Maintaining competitive integrity:

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| **Equipment/Ships** | Would break player-crafted economy |
| **Resources/Materials** | Would devalue gatherers |
| **Blueprints** | Must be earned through gameplay |
| **Direct Power** | No stats, damage, or advantages |
| **Skill Levels** | Only acceleration, not skipping |
| **OMEN Directly** | Only via player trading (NOVA) |
| **Inventory Space** | Earned through storage upgrades |
| **Exclusive Gameplay** | All content accessible to free players |

---

### Monetization Ethics

#### Principles
1. **No Pay-to-Win** - Money cannot buy power
2. **Respect Time** - Paying players save time, not skip content
3. **Player Economy** - Money flows through players, not bypasses them
4. **Cosmetic Focus** - Most revenue from vanity items
5. **Transparent Value** - Clear pricing, no predatory mechanics

#### Anti-Predatory Measures

| Measure | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Spending Limits** | Optional monthly cap setting |
| **Purchase History** | Clear transaction records |
| **No Loot Boxes** | Direct purchase only, no gambling |
| **Refund Window** | 24-hour refund on unused NOVA items |
| **Age Verification** | Parental controls for minors |
| **No FOMO Pressure** | Limited items return in rotation |

---

### Revenue Projections (Conceptual)

| Source | % of Revenue | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **NOVA Sales** | 50% | Primary revenue driver |
| **Battle Pass** | 25% | Seasonal recurring |
| **Direct Skin Sales** | 20% | Whale spending |
| **LAP Sales** | 5% | Supplementary |

---

### Free vs Paying Player Experience

| Aspect | Free Player | Paying Player |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **All Content** | ✅ Full access | ✅ Full access |
| **Progression Speed** | Normal | Faster (with LAP) |
| **OMEN Earning** | Gameplay only | Can buy via NOVA |
| **Cosmetics** | Limited (events, achievements) | Full access |
| **Competitive Viability** | ✅ Equal | ✅ Equal |
| **Time Investment** | Higher | Lower |

### Travel Methods

#### 1. Local Travel (Within System)

Movement within a single star system.

| Method | Speed | Fuel Cost | Use Case |
|--------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Sub-light** | Slow | None | Short distances, combat |
| **In-system Warp** | Fast | Low | Planet to planet |
| **Autopilot** | Medium | Low | AFK travel, safe zones |

**In-system Warp:**
- Point-to-point instant travel
- Requires warp drive charge (5-30 seconds based on distance)
- Can be disrupted by Warp Scramblers
- Leaves warp signature (trackable briefly)

#### 2. Inter-system Travel (Between Systems)

Travel between star systems via Jump Gates or Jump Drives.

| Method | Speed | Cost | Requirements |
|--------|-------|------|--------------|
| **Jump Gate** | Instant | Toll (OMEN) | Gate access |
| **Jump Drive** | Instant | Fuel (high) | Ship module |
| **Wormhole** | Instant | Free | Find entrance |

---

### Jump Gates

Fixed structures connecting major systems. Primary method of inter-system travel.

#### Gate Network

| Route | Toll Cost | Zone at Gate |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Uurf ↔ Banx | 500 OMEN | Friendly |
| Uurf ↔ Spira | 500 OMEN | Friendly |
| Banx ↔ Spira | 500 OMEN | Friendly |
| Banx ↔ Cryo Haven | 1,000 OMEN | Friendly |
| Banx ↔ Dust Port | 1,000 OMEN | Mild |
| Banx ↔ Nexus Gate | 1,500 OMEN | Mild |
| Dust Port ↔ Nexus Gate | 2,000 OMEN | Full |
| Nexus Gate ↔ Uncharted | 5,000 OMEN | Hardcore |

#### Gate Mechanics

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Activation** | Approach gate, pay toll, instant jump |
| **Cooldown** | 60 seconds before next gate use |
| **Cargo Scan** | Gates scan cargo (can't smuggle through) |
| **Gate Camps** | PvP common at gates in dangerous zones |
| **Gate Guns** | Friendly zone gates have defense turrets |

#### Gate Camp Dangers

Gates in Mild/Full/Hardcore zones are prime ganking locations:
- Gankers wait on exit side
- No gate guns to protect you
- Must fight or escape immediately
- Scout before jumping recommended

---

### Jump Drives

Ship-mounted module for direct system-to-system travel without gates.

#### Jump Drive Tiers

| Tier | Range | Fuel Cost | Charge Time | Ship Size |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| T3 | Adjacent systems | 500 fuel | 60s | M+ |
| T5 | 2 systems | 1,000 fuel | 45s | M+ |
| T7 | 3 systems | 2,000 fuel | 30s | L+ |
| T8 | Any system | 5,000 fuel | 15s | L+ |

**Jump Drive Advantages:**
- Bypass gate camps
- No toll fees
- Choose entry point (not fixed gate location)
- Element of surprise

**Jump Drive Disadvantages:**
- High fuel cost
- Requires large ship
- Expensive to craft
- Creates jump signature (detectable)

---

### Fuel System

All warp and jump travel consumes fuel.

#### Fuel Types

| Fuel | Source | Used For |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Standard Fuel** | Refined hydrogen | In-system warp |
| **Jump Fuel** | Helium-3 + Xenon | Jump drives |
| **Emergency Fuel** | Crafted | Single emergency warp |

#### Fuel Consumption

| Action | Fuel Cost |
|--------|-----------|
| In-system warp (short) | 10-50 units |
| In-system warp (long) | 50-200 units |
| Jump drive activation | 500-5,000 units |
| Afterburner (per minute) | 20 units |

#### Fuel Capacity by Ship Size

| Size | Fuel Tank | Range (approx) |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| XS | 500 units | 5-10 warps |
| S | 1,000 units | 10-20 warps |
| M | 2,500 units | 25-50 warps |
| L | 5,000 units | 50-100 warps |
| XL | 10,000 units | 100+ warps |

#### Refueling

| Location | Cost | Speed |
|----------|------|-------|
| Major city station | Market price | Instant |
| Outpost | +20% markup | Instant |
| Ship refinery | Craft from gases | Slow |
| Fuel drone | Automated | Medium |

**Running Out of Fuel:**
- Ship is stranded
- Must call for tow (expensive)
- Or wait for rescue
- Sitting duck for gankers

---

### Wormholes

Random spawning connections to distant or hidden locations.

| Type | Destination | Duration | Danger |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Stable** | Known system | 24 hours | Varies |
| **Unstable** | Random system | 1-4 hours | High |
| **Ancient** | Uncharted space | 30 min | Extreme |
| **Anomaly** | Hidden locations | 10 min | Unknown |

**Wormhole Mechanics:**
- Spawn randomly in space
- Detectable by deep scanners
- Two-way travel (usually)
- Collapse after time limit or mass limit
- Can be camped by players

**Wormhole Hunting:**
- Lucrative exploration activity
- Find shortcuts to valuable areas
- Sell wormhole locations to others
- Risk: Unknown what's on other side

---

### Galaxy Map & Exploration Reveal

The galaxy map is a **fog-of-war system** — the universe starts mostly hidden and reveals itself as the player explores. Explored areas show progressively more detail based on how thoroughly the player has surveyed them.

---

#### Map Layers

The map operates at three zoom levels, each with its own fog-of-war state:

**Layer 1: Galaxy View** (zoomed out — all systems)
```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                  │
│     [???]         [???]         [???]            │  ← Unexplored systems
│       │             │             │              │     show as dim outlines
│       └─────────────┼─────────────┘              │
│                     │                            │

│                     │                            │
│          ┌──────────┴──────────┐                 │
│      [VULCAN BELT]       [SOL PROXIMA]           │
│        (Spira)              (Uurf)               │
│                                                  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Layer 2: System View** (zoomed in — one system)
- Shows planets, stations, gates, and routes within that system
- Unexplored planets appear as unnamed silhouettes with basic size/type info
- Explored planets show full detail (name, resources, gravity, zones)

**Layer 3: Planet Surface View** (zoomed in — one planet)
- Shows terrain, landing zones, outposts, and resource deposits
- Unexplored areas are covered in fog
- Fog lifts as the player flies over or drives through the terrain

---

#### Exploration States

Every location has one of four discovery states, each revealing more information:

| State | How to Achieve | What's Visible |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| **Unknown** | Default state | Dim outline only (galaxy view) or blank fog (planet view). Tooltip shows "???" |
| **Detected** | Fly within scanner range of the system/area, or buy a star chart | Name, type, and zone danger level. No resource or terrain data |
| **Surveyed** | Enter the system/land on planet and activate scanner sweep | Full topography, resource deposit locations (general markers), gravity, hazards, points of interest |
| **Mapped** | Thoroughly explore on foot/vehicle/craft. Complete cartography quests | Exact resource quantities and purity, underground deposits, creature spawns, NPC patrol routes, hidden sites |

#### What Each State Reveals

**Galaxy View (System-level):**

| Data | Unknown | Detected | Surveyed | Mapped |
|------|---------|----------|----------|--------|
| System name | ??? | Visible | Visible | Visible |
| Jump gate connections | Hidden | Visible | Visible | Visible |

| NPC patrol routes | Hidden | Hidden | Hidden | Visible |
| Safe paths | Hidden | Hidden | Hidden | Optimal routes highlighted |

---

#### How the Map Reveals

**Passive Reveal (Fog-of-War):**
- Flying your Nimbus reveals terrain in a radius around you based on altitude:
  - Low altitude (ground level): ~200m reveal radius, high detail
  - Medium altitude: ~500m reveal radius, medium detail
  - High altitude: ~2km reveal radius, low detail (topography only, no resource data)
- Driving a ground vehicle reveals ~100m radius with high detail
- Revealed terrain stays permanent on your map

**Active Reveal (Scanner Sweeps):**
- Using your scanner at any location upgrades that area from Detected → Surveyed
- Scanner range depends on equipped scanner tier:

| Scanner | Sweep Radius | Detail Level |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Basic Scanner | 500m | Surface deposits, terrain |
| Advanced Scanner | 1km | + resource quality |
| Deep Core Scanner | 2km | + underground deposits |
| Quantum Scanner | 5km | + hidden sites, anomalies |

**Purchased Reveal (Star Charts):**
- Buy star charts from Veth merchants or other players
- Instantly upgrades a system or planet from Unknown → Detected
- Some rare charts go straight to Surveyed
- Cannot buy Mapped status — that requires boots on the ground

---

#### Exploration Progress & Rewards

---

#### Exploration Fame

Exploring unknown places earns **Exploration Fame (EF)** — a public reputation score displayed on the player's profile. Fame is the explorer's currency: it opens doors, attracts contracts, and establishes your name across the galaxy.

**Earning Fame:**

| Action | Fame Earned | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| First to enter an unknown system | +500 EF | One-time, first player only |
| First to land on an unexplored planet | +200 EF | One-time, first player only |
| Reach 25/50/75/100% planet exploration | +50/100/200/500 EF | Per planet |
| Discover a derelict or ruin | +100-300 EF | Based on site rarity |
| Discover an artifact or relic | +150-1000 EF | Based on artifact tier |
| Complete a cartography contract | +50-150 EF | Repeatable |
| Share/sell map data used by 10+ players | +100 EF | Others found your data useful |
| Survive a trip to Uncharted Space | +300 EF | Per expedition |

**"First Discovery" System:**
- The first player to find a location, artifact, or relic gets their name permanently attached to it
- Example: "Burrower Nest Delta — *Discovered by [PlayerName]*"
- First discoveries grant 3x fame bonus
- Discovery history viewable on the galaxy map (tap any discovered site to see who found it)

**Fame Tiers & Perks:**

| Fame | Rank | Perk |
|------|------|------|
| 0-999 | **Wanderer** | Access to basic cartography contracts |
| 1,000-4,999 | **Pathfinder** | +5% scanner range, Veth merchants offer better star charts |
| 5,000-14,999 | **Surveyor** | +10% scanner range, unique Surveyor ship skin, access to Veth generation ships |
| 15,000-49,999 | **Explorer** | +15% scanner range, exploration-only auction house, NPC explorers recognize you |
| 50,000+ | **Trailblazer** | +20% scanner range, unique title on leaderboard, Veth offer secret star charts to Uncharted regions |

---

#### Discoveries: Sites, Artifacts & Relics

The galaxy is scattered with hidden things waiting to be found. These are not quest objectives — they exist in the world and reward players who explore thoroughly.

**Discovery Types:**

**Sites** — Locations of interest found on planet surfaces or in space.

| Site Type | Where Found | How to Find | Reward |
|-----------|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Crash Site** | Planet surfaces | Visible from air at low altitude | Salvage, cargo, data logs |
| **Hidden Cave** | Planet surfaces (cliff faces, canyons) | Ground-level exploration, terrain scanner | Rare minerals, creature nests, shelter |
| **Abandoned Outpost** | Planet surfaces, remote areas | Scanner anomaly at Surveyed+ state | Equipment caches, NPC lore, sometimes operational facilities |
| **Battlefield Remnant** | Space, orbit zones | Scanner sweep in conflict-era systems | Spira Conflict salvage, military blueprints |
| **Precursor Marker** | Planet surfaces, moons | Quantum Scanner, or following Veth clues | Leads to Precursor ruins, lore fragments |
| **Wormhole Pocket** | Deep space, Uncharted | Rare scanner detection | Hidden areas with unique resources |

**Artifacts** — Portable objects found at discovery sites. Can be kept, studied, sold, or donated.

| Artifact Type | Rarity | Found At | Value |
|---------------|--------|----------|-------|
| **Data Core** | Common | Crash sites, derelicts | Contains star charts, lore entries, or encrypted blueprints |
| **Navigation Fragment** | Uncommon | Precursor markers, ruins | Reveals locations of other hidden sites when decoded |
| **Cultural Relic** | Uncommon | Abandoned outposts, battlefields | Lore item, high sell value to collectors or faction NPCs |
| **Prototype Component** | Rare | Research vessels, Precursor ruins | Used in crafting unique equipment variants |
| **Exodus Artifact** | Very Rare | Colony ship fragments, deep Uncharted | Items from the original arkships — enormous lore significance and trade value |
| **Void Shard** | Extremely Rare | Void rifts, deep Precursor sites | Mysterious material tied to the Breach — unknown potential |

**Relics** — Legendary one-of-a-kind items. Only one exists per server. Finding one is a major event.

| Relic | Location | Effect |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **The Shepherd's Compass** | Deep Uncharted Space | Permanently reveals all Precursor marker locations galaxy-wide for the holder |
| **Arkship Black Box** | One of the five lost colony ships | Contains the truth about the Shepherd Signal — unlocks unique storyline |
| **Korvani War Crown** | Hidden Korvani exile temple | Grants instant max Korvani reputation + unique combat ability |
| **Veth Memory Crystal** | Veth generation ship graveyard | Grants instant max Veth reputation + unique scanner ability |
| **Void Heart** | Beyond the Breach | ??? (endgame content, effect TBD) |

**Relic Rules:**
- Only one of each relic exists per server
- When a relic is found, a galaxy-wide announcement is made
- Relics can be stolen via PvP (they cannot be stored safely — must be carried or hidden)
- If the holder quits or is inactive 30+ days, the relic returns to the world in a new location
- Relics cannot be destroyed or traded — only taken by force or surrendered

**Artifact Interactions:**

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Keep** | Display in ship cabin (cosmetic), some grant passive bonuses |
| **Study** | Take to Cryo Haven research lab — decode for blueprints, maps, or lore |
| **Sell** | Sell to players or NPC collectors for OMEN |
| **Donate to Faction** | Large reputation boost with the relevant faction |
| **Combine** | Some artifacts form sets that unlock hidden locations or bonus effects |

#### Map Sharing & Social

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Share Waypoint** | Send a single location to another player (free) |
| **Share Map Data** | Export your explored data for a region and send/sell it to other players |
| **Guild Map** | Guild members' exploration data pools together automatically |
| **Cartography Contracts** | Quest board missions to survey unexplored areas for OMEN |
| **Map Marketplace** | Buy/sell star charts and survey data on the market |

**Map Data Economy:**
- First player to fully map a planet can sell that data at premium prices
- Map data degrades over time as resources deplete and respawn — buyers get a snapshot, not live updates
- Rare/hidden locations discovered by explorers create valuable, tradeable intel
- Veth faction reputation unlocks pre-Surveyed data for select regions

### Loading Screens & Tips

Loading screens display contextual tips that help players learn the game. Tips are selected based on the player's current progression, recent activity, and where they're headed.

#### Tip Selection Logic

| Priority | Condition | Example |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **1st** | Mechanic the player hasn't used yet | "Try deploying a ground vehicle for deep deposits" |
| **2nd** | Related to current destination/activity | Loading into a Mild zone → PvP awareness tip |
| **3rd** | Related to recent death or failure | Died to overheating → "Mining lasers overheat with continuous use. Fire in bursts for longer operation" |
| **4th** | Current storyline act hint | In Act 2 → gravity/weight tips |
| **5th** | General tip from random pool | Lore facts, efficiency tricks, social features |

#### Tip Categories

**Piloting (shown to T1-T3 players frequently, T4+ occasionally)**
- "Higher altitude reveals more terrain on your map, but surface deposits need low-altitude scanning."
- "Auto-stabilization keeps your craft steady while mining. Toggle it off for sharper turns in combat."
- "Your cargo weight affects flight handling. A full hold means slower turns and longer braking."
- "Double-tap a destination to engage auto-pilot. Keep your eyes on the scanner while cruising."

**Mining & Resources**
- "Fire your mining laser in short bursts to manage heat. Overheating damages your equipment."
- "Deep deposits can only be reached with ground vehicles. Look for the blue downward arrow on your scanner."
- "Different planets have different resources. Check the system map for resource types before committing to a trip."
- "Refining ore on-site with a Crawler reduces its weight — useful on high-gravity worlds."

**Weight & Gravity**
- "Check a planet's gravity before landing. Heavy worlds limit how much you can carry back to orbit."
- "Overweight takeoff burns extra fuel and risks engine failure. Jettison low-value cargo if needed."
- "Low-gravity asteroids let you haul massive loads — but deposits are sparser."
- "Your weight HUD turns yellow at 80% capacity and red at 100%. Plan your loads carefully."

**Crafting & Economy**
- "Repair kits can only restore equipment to 80% durability. Visit a station for full repairs."
- "Equipment that hits 0% durability is broken and must be repaired before use."
- "Every item in the market is crafted by another player. Supply and demand set the price."
- "Spira offers 25% reduced refining costs. Worth the trip for big processing jobs."

**Combat & Survival**
- "In Full PvP zones, destroyed ships drop cargo AND equipped modules. Don't fly what you can't afford to lose."
- "Hostile creatures guard the best resource deposits. Clear the nest for uncontested mining access."
- "Shields recharge over time, armor does not. Pick your defense based on your playstyle."
- "Escape is always an option. Warp drives charge faster with higher-tier thrusters."

**Exploration & Map**
- "Fly low over unexplored terrain to reveal it on your map. The fog lifts permanently."
- "The first player to discover a location gets their name permanently attached to it."
- "Buy star charts from Veth merchants to reveal distant systems without visiting them."
- "Fully mapping a planet grants +10% mining yield there permanently."

**Social & Multiplayer**
- "You can sell your map data to other players on the market. Explorers profit from knowledge."
- "Guild members share exploration data automatically. Join a guild to fill your map faster."
- "Player contracts let you hire escorts for dangerous zone runs. Sometimes it's cheaper than losing cargo."
- "Place a bounty on a player who wronged you. At 100K+, they're visible system-wide."

**Lore & World (unlocked progressively)**
- "The Shepherd Signal led humanity to the Cradle Stars. No one knows who sent it... yet."
- "Banx Station appeared in 2289 at the exact center of all five systems. Coincidence?"
- "The Veth call the Precursors 'The Weavers.' The Korvani call them 'The First Flame.'"
- "OMEN occasionally pulses in unison across the entire galaxy. Researchers who study this tend to disappear."
- "Seven of twelve arkships arrived at the Cradle Stars. The other five were never found."

## Art Direction & Visual Style

Odyssey uses a **2.5D isometric voxel art style** with medium-detail voxels, flat hand-painted lighting, and biome-driven color palettes. The visual target is approachable, charming, and highly readable on mobile screens — closer to Voxie Tactics than Minecraft. Every visual decision prioritizes clarity at small screen sizes while maintaining a cohesive, warm identity across the galaxy.

---

### Visual Pillars

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Readable at a Glance** | Silhouettes, color coding, and scale differences ensure the player can instantly parse ship types, resource nodes, enemies, and terrain — even on a 5" phone screen |
| **Warm & Inviting** | Soft, desaturated colors and rounded voxel shapes make the universe feel welcoming, not hostile — players should want to explore, not dread the unknown |
| **Handcrafted Feel** | Environments should look like dioramas built by hand — imperfect, charming, full of small details that reward zooming in |
| **Biome Identity** | Every planet, station, and zone has a distinct color signature so players always know where they are without checking the map |

---

### Camera & Perspective

**Fixed Isometric Camera** — all gameplay contexts (stations, planets, open space, combat) use the same isometric angle for visual consistency.

| Context | Camera Behavior |
|---------|----------------|
| **Stations & Cities** | Fixed isometric, tight zoom — buildings, NPCs, market terminals, and docking bays fill the frame. Player ship is parked/docked in view |
| **Planet Surface** | Fixed isometric, medium zoom — terrain tiles, resource nodes, ground vehicles, and mining operations visible. Parallax background layers add depth |
| **Open Space** | Fixed isometric, wide zoom — ship moves across a 2D plane. Asteroids, nebulae, and other ships rendered as voxel props at varying depth layers. Background star field and distant planets provide parallax |
| **Combat** | Same isometric angle, camera auto-frames the engagement. Slight zoom-in on weapon fire / explosions for impact. Camera shake on heavy hits (subtle — mobile comfort) |
| **Docking / Undocking** | Smooth zoom transition between space view and station view — no hard cuts |

**Zoom Levels:**
- Player can pinch-zoom between **3 fixed zoom levels** (close / default / wide) in all contexts
- Default zoom is tuned per context (tighter in stations, wider in space)
- No free rotation — isometric angle is locked to maintain the 2.5D illusion

---

### Voxel Fidelity

Medium-detail voxels — small enough to create recognizable, detailed shapes, large enough to read as intentionally voxelized. The Voxie Tactics / Octopath Traveler HD-2D aesthetic is the north star: you can clearly see the voxel construction, but objects have form, character, and personality.

| Element | Voxel Resolution | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| **Ships (XS–S)** | ~16×16×8 voxels | Compact, strong silhouettes. Class identity comes from shape (pointy = Scout, boxy = Freighter) |
| **Ships (M)** | ~24×24×12 voxels | More detail — visible cockpits, thruster vents, cargo bays |
| **Ships (L–XL)** | ~32×32×16 voxels | Maximum detail. Modular look — you can see individual weapon mounts and module hardpoints |
| **Characters / NPCs** | ~8×8×16 voxels | Chibi proportions (large head, small body). Expressive through color and accessories, not facial detail |
| **Buildings / Structures** | ~32×32×32+ voxels | Chunky architecture with visible interior glow through windows. Each city has signature building shapes |
| **Terrain Tiles** | ~8×8×4 voxels per tile | Tiled seamlessly. Surface detail (grass tufts, rock cracks, sand ripples) via color variation, not geometry |
| **Resource Nodes** | ~8×8×8 voxels | Glowing, distinct shapes per resource type. Must pop against terrain from default zoom |
| **Asteroids** | ~12×12×12 voxels | Irregular, jagged shapes. Color indicates resource content |
| **Drones** | ~6×6×4 voxels | Tiny, buzzy, recognizable by glow color and movement pattern |
| **Weapons / Equipment** | ~4×4×8 voxels | Visible when mounted on ships. Lasers glow, cannons have visible barrels, missiles have fins |

**Scale Hierarchy:** The size difference between a player's S-class Scout and an XL Capital ship should be immediately dramatic — Capitals should feel like floating cities next to a Scout's tiny silhouette.

---

### Color Palette

#### Palette Philosophy

Soft, desaturated tones dominate. No pure blacks, no pure whites, no fully saturated primaries. The palette leans warm overall but shifts per biome. Colors should feel like they've been gently sun-bleached — lived in, not factory-new.

#### Global Palette (used everywhere)

| Role | Color Range | Hex Examples | Usage |
|------|------------|--------------|-------|
| **Background / Space** | Deep navy, muted indigo | `#1a1e3a`, `#2b2d5e` | Star field, deep space, UI backdrops |
| **Highlight / Interactive** | Warm amber, soft gold | `#d4a855`, `#c49244` | Interactable objects, quest markers, UI accents |
| **Danger / Enemy** | Dusty red, terracotta | `#b85450`, `#8c3a36` | Hostile ships, PvP zones, damage indicators |
| **Friendly / Safe** | Sage green, soft teal | `#7a9e7e`, `#5f8a8b` | Friendly zones, allied ships, positive feedback |
| **OMEN Currency** | Warm gold with soft glow | `#d4a855` | OMEN icons, transaction confirmations |
| **NOVA Currency** | Cool silver-blue with shimmer | `#8eafc4` | NOVA icons, premium UI elements |
| **Neutral / Inactive** | Warm gray, stone | `#8a8578`, `#6b665d` | Disabled buttons, unowned territory, background props |

#### Biome Palettes

Each biome has a **dominant tone**, an **accent tone**, and a **sky/atmosphere color** that together create instant location recognition.

| Biome | Dominant | Accent | Sky / Atmosphere | Example Locations |
|-------|----------|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Temperate** | Sage green, warm tan | Cream, soft yellow | Pale blue with wispy clouds | Uurf (Sol Proxima) |
| **Arid / Desert** | Dusty orange, terracotta | Bleached bone, sandstone | Hazy amber, pale peach | Dust Port regions |
| **Volcanic** | Deep crimson, charcoal | Molten amber, ash gray | Dark red-brown haze, ember particles | Volcanic planets |
| **Ice / Tundra** | Pale blue, frost white | Cool lavender, steel gray | White-gray overcast, soft snowfall | Ice planets, deep space stations |
| **Jungle / Lush** | Deep emerald, moss | Bright amber flowers, teal water | Humid green-gray, dappled light | Lush exoplanets |
| **Industrial** | Gunmetal, rust | Weld-spark orange, warning yellow | Smoggy gray-brown | Spira, Forge Station, factory planets |
| **Exotic / Uncharted** | Deep violet, void blue | Ethereal teal glow, crystalline white | Black with bioluminescent particles | Uncharted Space, Precursor ruins |
| **Nebula (Space)** | Varies per nebula | Translucent layered gradients | N/A — nebula IS the backdrop | Space regions between systems |

**Transitions:** When flying between biomes or zones, the color palette cross-fades over **3–5 seconds** so the shift feels natural, not jarring.

---

### Lighting

**Flat / Hand-Painted Lighting** — minimal dynamic shadows, maximum readability.

| Aspect | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| **Primary Light** | Single fixed directional light per scene, baked into voxel face colors at build time. Light direction consistent across all isometric views (top-left source) |
| **Shadows** | Painted into the voxel colors, not cast dynamically. Underside/right-side faces use slightly darker versions of the surface color. No real-time shadow maps |
| **Ambient Occlusion** | Subtle, pre-baked AO in tight corners (where walls meet floors, inside crevices). Adds depth without rendering cost |
| **Glow / Emission** | Key interactive and important objects emit a soft bloom glow: resource nodes, OMEN drops, active weapon fire, engines, station lights, quest markers. Glow is the main way to draw attention |
| **Time of Day** | Planets have a fixed time-of-day per zone (some areas are always dusk, others always noon). No real-time day/night cycle — each area is designed for its specific lighting |
| **Space Lighting** | Ships are lit by the nearest star (warm tone near stars, cool tone in deep space). Nebulae cast faint colored ambient light on nearby objects |
| **Weapon VFX** | Lasers = bright energy-colored glow trails. Cannons = muzzle flash + impact spark. Missiles = exhaust trail + explosion bloom. All are flat 2D sprite effects layered over the voxel scene |
| **Explosions** | Ship destruction uses a burst of warm-toned particles (voxel chunks flying outward) + a brief screen flash. Wreck remains as a dim, non-glowing object |

**Performance Principle:** No per-pixel lighting, no real-time shadows, no dynamic global illumination. All lighting is solved at asset creation time. The GPU budget goes to particle effects, UI rendering, and maintaining 30+ FPS on target devices.

---

### Ship Visual Design

Ships are the player's primary visual identity — they must be instantly recognizable by class and size, customizable, and satisfying to watch in motion.

#### Design Language Per Size

| Size | Silhouette | Proportions | Visual Density |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **XS** | Compact, rounded | Slightly taller than wide. Pod-like | Minimal — 2-3 colors, simple shape |
| **S** | Sleek, angular or tapered | Longer than tall. Wing-like extensions | Low — visible cockpit, 1-2 mounted weapons |
| **M** | Chunky, functional | Roughly cubic with asymmetric features | Medium — cargo bays, weapon turrets, thruster banks |
| **L** | Imposing, layered | Wide and flat or tall and blocky. Bridge visible | High — multiple weapon mounts, antenna arrays, hangar doors |
| **XL** | Massive, city-like | Dwarfs all other ships. Multi-section | Maximum — docking ports, drone bays, command towers, running lights |

#### Engine & Thruster VFX

| Ship State | Thruster Visual |
|------------|----------------|
| **Idle / Docked** | No thruster glow — engines dark |
| **Cruising** | Soft glow from thruster voxels + 2-3 small particle trails (color matches ship accent) |
| **Boost / Warp Charge** | Bright glow + elongated trails + slight motion blur on the ship |
| **Warp Jump** | Stretch effect (ship elongates briefly), flash, then gone. Arrival = reverse stretch + flash |
| **Damaged** | Thruster glow flickers, trails are uneven/sputtering, smoke particles from hull |

#### Ship Customization (Visual)

| Layer | Options | Source |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Hull Color** | Primary + accent color selection (from unlocked palette) | Default set free; rare colors from crafting, loot, NOVA store |
| **Decals** | Small voxel patterns applied to hull (stripes, insignia, symbols) | Guild crests auto-applied; others from achievements/store |
| **Thruster Trail Color** | Changes particle trail color | Cosmetic crafting or NOVA store |
| **Weapon Glow** | Tints weapon fire VFX | Cosmetic drops from Hardcore zones |
| **Name Plate** | Voxel-style text floating below ship (visible to other players) | Free — player names their ship |

All cosmetics are **visual only** — zero gameplay impact.

---

### Environment Design

#### Station & City Interiors

Stations are viewed from the fixed isometric angle. They feel like detailed voxel dioramas the player navigates through.

| Element | Design Approach |
|---------|----------------|
| **Buildings** | Chunky, stacked-block architecture. Each city has a signature shape language (Uurf = rounded domes, Spira = angular industrial, Banx = ornate crystalline) |
| **NPCs** | Chibi voxel characters stationed at fixed positions (vendors, quest givers, guards). Idle animations: head bobs, arm waves, tool usage |
| **Market Terminals** | Glowing kiosk-like structures with floating voxel holograms showing item previews |
| **Docking Bays** | Open-topped hangars where the player's ship is visible, parked. Other players' ships visible in adjacent bays |
| **Ambient Detail** | Floating cargo crates, sparking welders, steam vents, holographic signage, wandering drones — all pre-placed, not spawned dynamically |

#### Planet Surfaces

| Element | Design Approach |
|---------|----------------|
| **Terrain** | Tile-based voxel terrain with gentle elevation changes. Biome palette applied uniformly with subtle per-tile color variation |
| **Resource Nodes** | Distinct glowing shapes that pop against the terrain: crystal spires, ore boulders, gas vents. Glow intensity indicates quality/tier |
| **Vegetation** | Voxel trees, bushes, coral (on ocean biomes), mushrooms (cave biomes). Shapes are simple — 3-5 voxel clusters with color variation. No individual leaf detail |
| **Structures** | Ruins, abandoned mines, Precursor artifacts. Larger and more detailed than vegetation. Unique per biome |
| **Weather** | Particle-based: sand particles (desert), snow (tundra), rain (temperate), ash (volcanic), spores (jungle). All are flat 2D particles for performance |

#### Open Space

| Element | Design Approach |
|---------|----------------|
| **Star Field** | Multi-layer parallax background. Closest layer = medium stars (voxel dots), middle = faint star clusters, far = nebula gradients |
| **Asteroids** | Voxel rocks in varying sizes, slowly rotating. Clustered in belts with visible density gradients |
| **Nebulae** | Soft gradient clouds (2D sprites) in the background, tinted per region. Foreground nebulae have faint particle effects |
| **Planets (Distant)** | Large voxel spheres in the background, slowly rotating. Surface detail visible (continents, ice caps, cloud layers) |
| **Space Debris** | Post-combat: voxel chunks, cargo containers, flickering wreck hulls. Despawn after wreck timer (10 min) |
| **Zone Boundaries** | Subtle color shift in the background + faint grid-line effect at boundary edges. No hard walls — the palette change IS the boundary |

---

### UI Art Style

The UI is **voxel-integrated** — buttons, panels, icons, and HUD elements use the same chunky voxel/pixel aesthetic as the game world. The UI should feel like part of the universe, not a layer on top of it.

#### UI Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Chunky & Tactile** | Buttons look like voxel blocks with visible depth (top face lighter, sides darker). Press animations squish the button down like pushing a physical block |
| **Readable First** | Despite the voxel aesthetic, text is always rendered in a clean pixel font at high readability. No voxel-rendered text except for decorative headers |
| **Color Coded** | UI elements follow the global palette: amber for interactive, red for danger, green for safe, gray for inactive. No new colors introduced |
| **Consistent Depth** | UI panels have a slight 3D voxel border (2-3 pixel thick edges with lighting). Panels float over the game world with a subtle drop shadow |

#### HUD Layout (In-Flight)

| **Panels / Windows** | Rounded-corner voxel frames with a semi-transparent dark background. Stacked depth effect (active panel in front, inactive panels dimmed behind) |
| **Buttons** | Voxel blocks with embossed text. Primary actions = amber block. Cancel/back = gray block. Danger actions = red block |
| **Scrolling Lists** | Market orders, inventory grids, guild member lists use chunky row separators with alternating warm/cool gray backgrounds |
| **Transitions** | Menus slide in from screen edges with a slight bounce (like voxel blocks being placed). Close = slide out + subtle poof particle |
| **Tooltips** | Small voxel-bordered popups that appear on long-press. Show item stats, descriptions, tier info |

#### Tier Color System

Used consistently across all UI to instantly communicate item/equipment quality:

| Tier | Color | Hex | Glow |
|------|-------|-----|------|
| T1 (Scrap) | Warm gray | `#8a8578` | None |
| T2 (Basic) | Off-white | `#c8c0b0` | None |
| T3 (Standard) | Soft green | `#7a9e7e` | Faint |
| T4 (Quality) | Muted blue | `#6888a8` | Faint |
| T5 (Superior) | Dusty purple | `#8a6e9e` | Soft |
| T6 (Elite) | Deep violet | `#6e4a8e` | Medium |
| T7 (Prototype) | Warm orange | `#c47a3a` | Medium |
| T8 (Legendary) | Burnished gold | `#c49a2a` | Strong + particle sparkle |

### Animation Guidelines

All animations are **voxel-friendly** — snappy, discrete, and satisfying. No fluid skeletal animation — movement is expressed through position changes, rotations, squash/stretch, and particle effects.

| Element | Animation Style |
|---------|----------------|
| **Ship Movement** | Smooth position interpolation. Ships tilt slightly into turns (2-3° max). No banking or complex rotation |
| **Ship Damage** | Brief red flash on hit. Voxel chunks break off at low HP thresholds (75%, 50%, 25%). Smoke particles at <25% |
| **Ship Destruction** | Expand briefly → burst into voxel chunks that scatter outward with physics → fade after 2 seconds. Flash + screen shake |
| **Mining** | Laser beam (flat sprite) connects ship to node. Node pulses on each extraction tick. Small voxel fragments chip off the node |
| **Crafting** | Item voxels assemble piece by piece in the crafting UI (like a stop-motion build). Success = golden flash. Failure = pieces scatter |
| **NPC Idle** | Simple 2-3 frame loops: head bob, arm swing, tool spark. All pose-based, not interpolated |
| **UI Buttons** | Press = squish down (scale Y to 0.85). Release = bounce back. Hover/focus = gentle pulse glow |
| **Loot Drop** | Items pop out of wreck in an arc, land with a small bounce, then glow with tier-appropriate color |
| **Warp / Jump** | Ship stretches along travel axis → white flash → disappear. Arrival = reverse. Star field streaks during warp |
| **Zone Transition** | Background palette cross-fades. Subtle vignette pulse at the boundary. No loading screen for same-instance zones |

---

### Performance Budget

All visual decisions are constrained by the mobile performance targets defined in Technical Targets (30 FPS stable on mid-range, 60 FPS on high-end).

| Budget | Allocation |
|--------|-----------|
| **Draw Calls** | Target <200 per frame. Voxel meshes are batched aggressively by chunk. UI is a single atlas draw |
| **Polygon Count** | Target <50K triangles per frame (voxel meshes + UI + particles). Voxel LOD: distant objects use lower-resolution voxel meshes |
| **Texture Memory** | <128 MB. Voxel palettes use shared color lookup textures (1 palette texture per biome). No unique textures per object |
| **Particle Count** | <500 active particles per frame. Particles are 2D billboards, not voxel geometry |
| **Lighting** | Zero real-time lights. All lighting baked into voxel vertex colors. Glow effects use additive blend sprites |
| **Shader Complexity** | Simple unlit/vertex-lit shaders only. No PBR, no normal maps, no real-time reflections |
| **LOD Tiers** | 3 tiers: Full detail (<50m), Reduced (50–200m), Silhouette (>200m, single-color low-poly shape) |
| **Asset Streaming** | Voxel chunks stream in at zone boundaries. Pre-load adjacent zones during gameplay to avoid pop-in |

## Audio & Music Design

Odyssey's audio identity is **retro chiptune** — warm, melodic, and unmistakably game-y. The soundtrack draws from the FTL school of electronic game music: chill and atmospheric during exploration, sharp and urgent during combat. Sound effects are **stylized and chunky** to match the voxel art — every interaction should feel satisfying and tactile, like pressing buttons on a toy spaceship. Audio is a first-class design element, not an afterthought.

---

### Audio Pillars

| Pillar | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Memorable Melodies** | Players should be humming Odyssey's themes after a session. Catchy, looping chiptune melodies are the foundation — not ambient wash |
| **Satisfying Feedback** | Every player action — mining a node, firing a weapon, opening a menu, completing a craft — has a chunky, rewarding sound. Audio IS the feedback loop |
| **Sharp Contrast** | Exploration is calm and inviting; combat is intense and urgent. The audio shift is immediate and unmistakable — players know they're in danger before they read the HUD |
| **Biome Identity** | Each biome type has a distinct musical personality. Players should recognize where they are by sound alone |

---

### Main Theme

Odyssey has a **signature chiptune melody** that defines the game's audio identity.

| Context | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| **Title Screen** | Full arrangement — the definitive version. Upbeat, adventurous, slightly melancholic. Builds from a simple pulse-wave melody to a layered arrangement with arpeggiated bass, square-wave harmony, and triangle-wave lead |
| **New Player Intro** | Stripped-down arrangement plays during the Act 1 opening cinematic (Awakening) — solo melody on a soft synth pad, conveying wonder and vulnerability |
| **Key Story Moments** | Motif reprised in minor key during dark story beats, triumphant major key during victories. Fragments woven into biome tracks as subtle callbacks |
| **Achievement / Level Up** | 4-bar fanfare derived from the main melody. Instant recognition — "that's the Odyssey sound" |
| **Credits** | Full orchestral-chiptune hybrid arrangement with all biome motifs woven in |

**Style Reference:** FTL's title theme — immediately recognizable, sets the tone for the entire experience, simple enough to hum but layered enough to reward repeated listening.

---

### Music System

#### Track Structure

Music uses a **simple crossfade system** — each gameplay state has a dedicated track, and transitions between states crossfade over a defined duration. No dynamic stem layering.

| Transition | Crossfade Duration |
|------------|-------------------|
| Exploration → Combat | **1.5 seconds** (fast — urgency) |
| Combat → Exploration | **4 seconds** (slow — tension release) |
| Space → Station | **3 seconds** |
| Station → Space | **3 seconds** |
| Any → Death Screen | **0.5 seconds** fade to silence, then death sting |
| Any → Menu / Pause | **1 second** fade to 30% volume (music continues underneath) |
| Zone → Different Zone (same state) | **5 seconds** (smooth biome-to-biome blend) |

#### Track List by Context

**Biome Exploration Tracks** (one per biome type):

| Biome | Mood | Instruments | Tempo |
|-------|------|-------------|-------|
| **Temperate** | Warm, pastoral, hopeful | Soft square-wave melody, gentle arpeggiated bass, light triangle percussion | 90–100 BPM |
| **Arid / Desert** | Dusty, vast, lonesome | Detuned pulse-wave lead, sparse bass plucks, echo-heavy delay, filtered noise percussion | 80–90 BPM |
| **Volcanic** | Heavy, ominous, industrial | Low sawtooth drones, distorted bass, metallic percussion hits, slow pulse | 70–80 BPM |
| **Ice / Tundra** | Crystalline, quiet, delicate | High-register triangle-wave arpeggios, minimal bass, reverb-heavy, sparse bells | 70–85 BPM |
| **Jungle / Lush** | Lively, curious, layered | Fast arpeggiated patterns, bouncy bass line, chirpy high-frequency blips, rhythmic shakers | 110–120 BPM |
| **Industrial** | Mechanical, rhythmic, busy | Sequenced bass patterns, rhythmic noise gates, clicking percussion, metallic stabs | 100–110 BPM |
| **Exotic / Uncharted** | Eerie, wondrous, alien | Detuned harmonics, glitchy artifacts, reversed samples, unpredictable rhythm, wide stereo panning | 60–80 BPM |
| **Open Space** | Vast, serene, contemplative | Slow pad swells, distant pulse-wave melody (main theme fragment), deep sub-bass hum, minimal percussion | 70–80 BPM |

**Combat Tracks** (per zone danger level):

| Zone Type | Mood | Key Differences from Exploration |
|-----------|------|----------------------------------|
| **Mild Zone PvP** | Alert, competitive | +Driving percussion, +staccato bass, tempo jumps +20 BPM from current biome track. Still controlled — this is a fair fight |
| **Full Zone PvP** | Intense, high-stakes | +Heavy distorted bass, +rapid hi-hat patterns, +aggressive lead melody. Tempo 130–140 BPM regardless of biome. The stakes are real |
| **Hardcore Zone** | Frantic, desperate | Full Zone track + additional dissonant layers, glitchy stutters, compressed dynamics. Audio communicates "you could lose everything" |
| **PvE / NPC Combat** | Action, adventure | Upbeat combat music without the tension/desperation of PvP. Heroic melody, driving but not frantic. 110–120 BPM |
| **Conquest Battle** | Epic, warlike | Unique track — longest and most layered. Military-style percussion, call-and-response melody lines, builds to a climax. 120–130 BPM |

**Station & UI Tracks:**

| Context | Mood | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Major City (Uurf, Banx, Spira, etc.)** | Each city gets a unique arrangement of its biome track — same melody/key but different instrumentation and tempo | Uurf = warm and bustling, Banx = sleek and refined, Spira = industrial and rhythmic |
| **Market Screen** | Calm, focused, slightly jazzy | Low-key track that doesn't distract from reading numbers. Soft bass groove, muted melody |
| **Crafting Screen** | Meditative, rhythmic | Repetitive but pleasant — matches the rhythm of crafting actions. Builds subtly as craft queue fills |
| **Guild Hall** | Social, warm, communal | Upbeat arrangement of the main theme with added warmth. Slightly louder and more lively than solo exploration |
| **Inventory / Menus** | Neutral, quiet | Current location's track continues at reduced volume. No dedicated menu music |

**Special Tracks:**

| Context | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Title Screen** | Main theme — full arrangement (see Main Theme section) |
| **Death Screen** | 2-second sting (descending minor chord), then silence for 3 seconds, then a muted, slow reprise of the main theme melody. Somber but not punishing |
| **Warp / Jump** | 3-second swoosh effect with a rising pitch, then the destination biome track fades in |
| **Singularity Orb Compression** | Unique one-off — deep resonant tone building over the compression animation, climaxing with a crystalline chime burst. Designed to feel momentous (you just compressed 1,000,000 OMEN) |
| **First Undock (Tutorial)** | Soft reprise of the main theme building to the full Open Space track as the player leaves the station for the first time. Goosebump moment |
| **Storyline Cutscenes** | Composed per-scene. Arrangements of the main theme and biome motifs tailored to the narrative beat |

---

### Sound Effects

All SFX are **stylized and chunky** — designed to feel satisfying and tactile, matching the voxel art's handcrafted personality. Sound effects use synthesized/processed sources rather than realistic recordings. Every action the player takes should have an audio reward.

#### SFX Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Punchy Attacks** | All SFX have a fast, sharp attack transient — sounds "snap" into existence. No slow fades in |
| **Short Tails** | SFX decay quickly to avoid muddying the mix. Exceptions: explosions and ambient reverb |
| **Pitch Variation** | Repeated sounds (mining ticks, weapon fire, footsteps) randomly vary pitch ±5% per instance to avoid machine-gun repetition |
| **Layered Feedback** | Important actions layer 2-3 sounds: e.g., crafting success = anvil ring + sparkle chime + low bass thump |
| **Stereo Position** | SFX pan based on screen position (left/right of center). Off-screen events play at reduced volume with directional panning |

#### Weapon SFX

| Weapon Type | Sound Character | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|-------|
| **Laser** | Bright zap with a sustained buzz tail | Pitch rises with charge time. Continuous beam = sustained tone with wobble |
| **Cannon** | Deep, punchy thud with metallic ring | Low-frequency heavy hit. Screen shake pairs with audio impact |
| **Missile** | Whoosh launch → hiss travel → bass-heavy boom impact | 3-part sound: launch is sharp, travel is quiet hiss, impact is the payoff |
| **Railgun** | Charge whine (rising pitch) → sharp crack on fire | Charge duration matches the weapon's charge mechanic. Crack is the most satisfying sound in the game |
| **Mining Laser** | Warm hum + rhythmic clink on each extraction tick | Clink pitch varies by resource type: metallic for ores, crystalline for gems, soft for organics |
| **EMP / Disruptor** | Electrical crackle + bass drop | Sounds like systems failing — static bursts, power-down whine |

#### Impact & Damage SFX

| Event | Sound |
|-------|-------|
| **Shield Hit** | Electric sizzle + high-frequency ripple. Sounds like energy being absorbed. Pitch drops as shields get low |
| **Armor Hit** | Metallic clang + crunch. Heavier and more solid than shield hits |
| **Hull Hit** | Deep structural groan + crack. Sounds painful — the ship is hurting |
| **Critical Hit** | Normal hit sound + additional sharp "crack" layer + brief bass swell. Unmistakable — you know it was a crit |
| **Shield Break** | Descending electric whine → pop → silence. The silence sells it — shields are gone |
| **Ship Destruction** | Rapid crumpling metal → bass explosion → debris scatter (tinkling voxel chunks) → fade to muffled ringing. 2–3 seconds total |
| **Wreck Loot Spawn** | Soft chime cascade as items appear in wreck container |

#### UI SFX

| Action | Sound | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| **Button Press** | Soft chunky click (like pressing a mechanical keyboard key) | Pitch varies by button importance: primary = higher, cancel = lower |
| **Menu Open** | Quick ascending 3-note blip | Matches the voxel slide-in animation |
| **Menu Close** | Quick descending 2-note blip | Matches the slide-out animation |
| **Tab Switch** | Light tick | Subtle, non-intrusive |
| **Item Pickup / Loot** | Bright ascending chime — pitch and layering scales with item tier | T1 = single soft blip, T8 = multi-layered sparkle cascade |
| **OMEN Received** | Coin-like clink with warm resonance | Satisfying — players should enjoy hearing money come in |
| **NOVA Received** | Crystalline shimmer, cooler tone than OMEN | Premium feel — distinct from OMEN |
| **Craft Start** | Mechanical whir + click (materials loading in) | |
| **Craft Success** | Anvil ring + sparkle chime + bass thump | Triumphant, satisfying. The payoff for waiting |
| **Craft Failure** | Descending buzz + dull thud | Disappointing but not punishing. Brief |
| **Trade Confirm** | Double chime (both parties) + register "ka-ching" | Mutual confirmation feel |
| **Level Up / Skill Unlock** | Main theme fanfare (4 bars) + ascending arpeggio | The most rewarding sound in the game |
| **Quest Complete** | Triumphant brass-style chiptune stinger + OMEN clink cascade | 3 seconds, unmissable |
| **Error / Rejected Action** | Low buzz + single dull tone | Non-aggressive — communicates "nope" without frustration |
| **Chat Message Received** | Soft blip | Unobtrusive, blends into background |
| **Warning / Alert** | Rapid 3-pulse beep, ascending pitch | Catches attention without being alarming |
| **Critical Alert (hull low, zone danger)** | Klaxon-style repeating pulse, filtered to avoid being grating | Urgent but not annoying — player should act, not panic |

#### Ambient SFX

Ambient sound layers run continuously beneath the music to build atmosphere. Each context has an ambient bed:

| Context | Ambient Layer |
|---------|--------------|
| **Open Space** | Deep sub-bass hum (the void), distant star crackle, faint radio static, occasional metallic ping from hull thermal expansion |
| **Asteroid Belt** | Space ambient + low rumble of nearby rocks, occasional small impact ticks on hull |
| **Nebula** | Space ambient + ethereal whisper-like tones, soft electrical crackle, muffled filter on all sounds |
| **Station Interior** | Mechanical hum of life support, distant clanks and hisses, muffled PA announcements, crowd murmur (busy stations) |
| **Planet — Temperate** | Wind, rustling vegetation, distant animal calls (alien chirps/trills), water if near shore |
| **Planet — Desert** | Howling wind, sand hiss, deep silence between gusts, distant metallic groaning (heat expansion) |
| **Planet — Volcanic** | Rumbling bass, bubbling lava, hissing gas vents, cracking rock |
| **Planet — Ice** | Whistling wind, creaking ice, crystalline chimes from ice formations, muffled footsteps |
| **Planet — Jungle** | Dense layered sounds: insect-like buzzing, dripping water, creature calls, rustling canopy |
| **Planet — Industrial** | Machinery drone, rhythmic pounding, hydraulic hisses, sparking welders, conveyor clatter |
| **Exotic / Precursor Ruins** | Unearthly tones, resonant humming from ancient tech, glitchy digital artifacts, spatial audio that feels "wrong" |

All ambient layers are **looping and seamless** — no audible loop points. Volume is low enough to sit beneath music and SFX without competing.

---

### Spatial Audio

Even with a fixed isometric camera, spatial audio cues help the player track off-screen events:

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Stereo Panning** | Sounds pan left/right based on their screen-space position. Object at screen-left = audio pans left |
| **Distance Attenuation** | Sounds from distant objects are quieter and low-pass filtered (muffled). Nearby events are louder and brighter |
| **Off-Screen Indicators** | Combat sounds, explosions, and mining activity from off-screen play at reduced volume with directional panning — gives the player spatial awareness beyond the viewport |
| **Doppler (Ships)** | Fast-moving ships get a subtle pitch shift as they pass (rising → falling). Subtle, not realistic — just enough to convey speed |
| **Headphone Support** | Stereo widening for headphone users. No full 3D/binaural (mobile constraints), but wider stereo image than speakers |
| **Speaker Mode** | Reduced stereo width for phone speakers. Center-heavy mix to ensure nothing is lost on small mono speakers |

---

### Audio Settings

Players can customize their audio experience:

| Setting | Options | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Master Volume** | 0–100% slider | 80% |
| **Music Volume** | 0–100% slider | 70% |
| **SFX Volume** | 0–100% slider | 100% |
| **Ambient Volume** | 0–100% slider | 60% |
| **UI Sounds** | On / Off | On |
| **Combat Music** | On / Off (some players prefer ambient during combat) | On |
| **Critical Alerts** | Audio + Visual / Visual Only | Audio + Visual |
| **Haptic Feedback** | On / Off (vibration on weapon fire, impacts, explosions, UI presses) | On |
| **Background Audio** | Continue playing when app is backgrounded / Pause | Pause |

---

### Audio Performance Budget

| Constraint | Limit | Notes |
|------------|-------|-------|
| **Simultaneous Voices** | Max **24** active sound channels | Music: 2 (crossfade pair), Ambient: 2, SFX: up to 20 |
| **SFX Priority System** | Player actions > combat impacts > environmental > ambient detail | When voice limit is hit, lowest-priority sounds are culled first |
| **Audio Memory** | <**32 MB** total audio assets in memory | Use compressed formats (OGG Vorbis / AAC). Stream music, preload SFX |
| **Music File Size** | <**3 MB** per track (compressed) | ~2–3 minute loops, stereo, 44.1kHz |
| **SFX File Size** | <**100 KB** per effect (compressed) | Most SFX are <1 second. Longer effects (explosions, ambient) up to 3 seconds |
| **Latency** | <**50ms** from input to SFX playback | Critical for combat feedback — sounds must feel instant |
| **Format** | OGG Vorbis (Android) / AAC (iOS) | Platform-native decoders for minimal CPU overhead |

### Step 3: Server Selection

**There is no server selection.** There is one single open world and every player in the game shares it.

**Single Universe Design:**
- One persistent world for ALL players globally
- No shards, no instances, no region splits
- Every player sees the same galaxy, the same markets, the same resources
- What one player does affects everyone — mine a deposit, it's gone for others too
- The economy is truly global — one market, one OMEN supply, one leaderboard
- First discoveries, relics, world boss kills — they happen once, for everyone

**Why One World:**
- A single economy is more meaningful — supply and demand are real
- First discoveries actually matter — you're first in the ENTIRE game, not just your shard
- Player reputation carries weight — everyone knows the top traders, explorers, pirates
- Territory control and faction wars affect the whole galaxy
- The 1,000 Singularity Orb cap only works with one shared economy

**Technical Approach:**
- Distributed server architecture with regional edge nodes for low latency
- Players auto-connect to nearest edge node — no selection needed
- Edge nodes sync to central authoritative server for economy, map state, and persistence
- Spatial partitioning: areas with high player density dynamically allocate more server resources
- If extreme population requires it in the future: overflow layering for crowded cities only (same world, temporary visual separation, all actions still affect the shared state)

#### Callsign (Player Name)
- 3-16 characters
- Letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores
- Unique per server (real-time availability check as you type)
- Profanity filter
- Cannot be changed for 30 days after creation (prevent grief-name swapping)
- Displayed galaxy-wide on leaderboards, markets, discoveries, bounties

#### Avatar Preset
- **4 preset avatars** at launch (2 male, 2 female silhouettes)
- Swipe to browse
- These are simple portrait icons shown in chat, market listings, and profiles
- Full customization unlocked later in-game at any city (hair, face, suit color, helmet, etc.)
- NOT a blocker — players can skip and use default, customize whenever they want

#### What We Skip
- No class selection (classless progression — you ARE what you do)
- No race selection (all players are human)
- No stat allocation (stats come from equipment and skills)
- No ship selection (everyone starts with the same damaged shuttle — the story demands it)
- No lengthy backstory prompts

---

### Step 5: Intro Cinematic (45-60 seconds, skippable)

A short cinematic that sets the tone and drops the player directly into Act 1.

**Scene 1 (15s):** Black screen. Stars fade in. A calm voice narrates:
> *"In 2187, humanity fled a dying Earth. Twelve ships carried our last hope toward a signal no one understood."*

**Scene 2 (15s):** Camera pulls back to reveal the Cradle Stars — five star systems glittering. Ships moving between them.
> *"Seven ships arrived. Five centuries later, we built a new home among alien neighbors and ancient ruins."*

**Scene 3 (15s):** Camera zooms to a jump gate. A small, battered shuttle exits — sparks flying, hull cracked. Alarms blaring inside the cockpit.
> *"You are the latest arrival. Your ship is damaged. Your past is unclear. But the stars have plans for those who survive."*

**Scene 4 (transition):** Camera moves into the cockpit. The cinematic seamlessly transitions to gameplay — the HUD flickers on, emergency warnings flash, and the player has control.

- **Skippable** after first playthrough (hold to skip prompt in corner)
- First-time players cannot skip (it's only 45 seconds and sets up the story)
- No separate loading screen between cinematic and gameplay — it's one continuous shot

---

### Step 6: Gameplay Begins → Act 1, Chapter 1.1

The player is now in-game. They're sitting in a damaged shuttle drifting in Uurf orbit. From here, the Act 1 storyline takes over as the extended tutorial.

**Immediate state:**
- Ship is damaged — limited thrust, no weapons, no scanner
- Emergency HUD shows basic prompts
- Uurf is visible below — a blue-green planet
- A distress beacon marker pulses on the HUD

**First prompt:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                             │
│   ⚠ EMERGENCY                              │
│   Hull integrity: 34%                       │
│   Thrust: Limited                           │
│                                             │
│   Use LEFT STICK to steer toward the        │
│   beacon signal.                            │
│                          [Got it]           │
│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- One simple prompt, then the player is flying
- No more popups — all further guidance comes from HUD markers and NPC voice lines
- Kael's voice crackles over comms as you approach Uurf: *"Unidentified shuttle, you're coming in hot. I'll clear landing pad 7 — try not to miss."*

## Server Architecture & Networking

Odyssey runs on a **fully server-authoritative** architecture with a **single-shard universe**. All game state — economy, combat, loot, player positions — is owned and validated by the server. Clients send inputs; the server simulates the world and sends state updates back. This is non-negotiable for a game with a finite currency supply (OMEN), real-money premium currency (NOVA), and full-loot PvP zones. The architecture is designed to start small (1K–5K CCU at launch) and scale progressively without a rewrite.

### Core Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Server is Truth** | Clients never determine game outcomes. Combat damage, loot rolls, crafting results, market trades, OMEN/NOVA balances — all calculated server-side. Client sends intent ("fire weapon at target X"), server resolves the result |
| **Single Shard** | One galaxy, one economy, one player universe. No parallel shards splitting the community. Zones are the unit of scaling — add more zone server capacity as player count grows |
| **Cloud Agnostic** | Architecture defined in terms of capabilities (compute, DB, load balancer, message queue), not vendor-specific services. Deployable on AWS, GCP, or bare metal with containerization |
| **Stateless Servers** | Game servers and services hold no critical state in memory long-term. All persistent state lives in PostgreSQL. If a server crashes, another picks up the zone within seconds |
| **Horizontally Scalable** | Every layer can scale by adding more instances. Gateway: more WebSocket servers. Game: more zone servers. Economy: read replicas + queue-based writes. DB: connection pooling + read replicas |
| **Progressive Scaling** | Launch with minimal infrastructure (single region, few servers). Add regions, capacity, and services as player base grows. No over-provisioning at launch |

---

### Network Protocol

**WebSocket over TLS** for all client-server communication.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Protocol** | WebSocket (RFC 6455) over TLS 1.3 |
| **Why WebSocket** | Works on all mobile networks, no firewall issues, no NAT traversal problems, built-in browser support if web client is ever needed. TCP reliability for a game where every OMEN transaction matters |
| **Connection** | Client connects to the nearest gateway via DNS-based routing. Single persistent connection per session |
| **Message Format** | Binary — MessagePack or FlatBuffers for compact serialization. No JSON for real-time game state (too large, too slow to parse) |
| **Compression** | Per-message deflate (permessage-deflate extension) for large payloads. Delta compression for state updates — only send what changed since last tick |
| **Heartbeat** | Client sends ping every **10 seconds**. Server responds with pong + server timestamp (for clock sync). 3 missed heartbeats = connection timeout |
| **Reconnection** | Client auto-reconnects with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, max 30s). Server holds player session for **60 seconds** after disconnect — if client reconnects within window, player resumes exactly where they were (ship stays in space, not teleported) |
| **Bandwidth Target** | <**5 KB/s** average downstream per client during normal gameplay. <**15 KB/s** peak during large combat encounters. <**1 KB/s** upstream (player inputs are small) |

#### Message Types

| Category | Direction | Examples | Priority |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Input** | Client → Server | Move command, fire weapon, interact, dock, trade request | High |
| **State Update** | Server → Client | Entity positions, HP changes, zone population, nearby ships | High |
| **Economy** | Bidirectional | Market order, trade confirm, OMEN/NOVA balance update, craft request | Critical (guaranteed delivery + server acknowledgment) |
| **Social** | Bidirectional | Chat message, friend request, guild invite | Medium |
| **System** | Server → Client | Server announcements, maintenance warnings, event notifications | Low |
| **Analytics** | Client → Server | Performance metrics, input latency, FPS samples | Low (batched, non-blocking) |

All economy messages use a **request-acknowledge-confirm** pattern: client sends request → server validates → server sends acknowledge with result. Client does not update local state until server confirms. This prevents desync on anything involving currency or items.

---

### Game Server (Zone Simulation)

Each game server process runs the authoritative simulation for one or more **zones** of the galaxy.

#### Tick Rate

**20 Hz (50ms per tick)** — consistent across all zone types.

| Per-Tick Operations | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Input Processing** | Dequeue all player inputs received since last tick. Validate and apply movement, actions, commands |
| **Physics / Collision** | Simple 2D collision detection (isometric plane). Ship-to-ship, ship-to-asteroid, weapon projectile-to-target. No complex physics — grid-aligned with interpolation |
| **Combat Resolution** | Process weapon fire, apply damage (accounting for shields, armor, modules), check for kills, generate loot tables on destruction |
| **AI / NPC** | Update NPC patrol paths, pirate aggro logic, drone behavior, merchant inventory restocks |
| **State Snapshot** | Build delta snapshot of all entity states that changed this tick. Serialize and broadcast to all connected clients in the zone |
| **Persistence Flush** | Queue critical state changes (HP, inventory, position) for async DB write. Economy operations (OMEN transfers) are synchronous with DB transaction |

#### Zone Capacity

| Zone Type | Max Players | Entities (Total) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Open Space (Normal)** | 100 per zone | ~500 (ships + asteroids + NPCs + projectiles) | If player count exceeds limit, overflow players are placed in the adjacent zone and see a "zone is busy" indicator |
| **Station / City** | 50 per instance | ~200 (players + NPCs + props) | Stations auto-instance when population exceeds 50. Players can switch instances manually |
| **Planet Surface** | 50 per instance | ~300 (players + nodes + NPCs + fauna) | Same instancing as stations |
| **Hardcore Zone** | 50 per zone | ~300 | Deliberately lower cap — fights should be personal, not zergs |
| **Conquest Zone** | 200 per zone | ~1000 | Higher cap for large-scale guild battles. Dedicated higher-spec server |

#### Interest Management (Relevance Filtering)

Clients don't receive updates for every entity in the zone — only those within their **area of interest (AOI)**.

| Player State | AOI Radius | Update Frequency |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Flying (normal speed)** | 150 units (~3 screen widths) | Every tick (20 Hz) for nearby entities, every 5th tick (4 Hz) for edge-of-AOI entities |
| **Docked / Station** | Station bounds only | Every tick for same-station players, no updates from space |
| **Combat** | 200 units (expanded to include all combatants) | Every tick for all combat participants regardless of distance |
| **Warping** | None (warp is instantaneous transition) | No updates during warp animation. Full snapshot on arrival at destination zone |

Entities leaving AOI get a "fade out" message; entering AOI get a "spawn" message with full state. This prevents pop-in on the client.

---

### Gateway Layer

Gateways sit between clients and game servers. They handle connection management, authentication, routing, and protocol translation.

| Responsibility | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **Connection Management** | Accept WebSocket connections, TLS termination, heartbeat monitoring, graceful disconnect handling |
| **Authentication** | Validate session tokens on connect (JWT). Reject expired/invalid tokens. Rate-limit connection attempts per IP |
| **Routing** | Route client messages to the correct zone server based on the player's current zone. Handle zone transfers (player warps to a new zone → gateway reconnects them to the new zone server seamlessly) |
| **Compression** | Compress outbound state updates. Decompress inbound messages if client uses compression |
| **Rate Limiting** | Per-client message rate limits (max 30 inputs/sec). Reject excess messages, flag suspicious clients for anti-cheat review |
| **Buffering** | Buffer messages during zone transfers so clients don't see a gap. Queue outbound messages if client's send buffer is full (slow connection) |

**Scaling:** Each gateway handles ~2,000 concurrent WebSocket connections. Add more gateway instances behind the load balancer as CCU grows. Gateways are stateless — any gateway can serve any client.

---

### Economy Service

The economy is the most security-critical service in Odyssey. It runs as a **separate service** from game servers to isolate it from zone simulation failures and to enable independent scaling, auditing, and hardening.

| Responsibility | Detail |
|---------------|--------|
| **OMEN Ledger** | Double-entry ledger for all OMEN movement. Every transfer has a debit and credit entry. Ledger is append-only — no updates or deletes. Total OMEN across all entries always sums to 1,000,000,000 |
| **NOVA Ledger** | Same double-entry system for NOVA. Ties to IAP receipt validation (Apple/Google) |
| **Market Engine** | Order book matching for player-to-player market trades. Price-time priority. Supports limit orders and instant-buy/sell against existing orders |
| **Trade Validation** | All player-to-player trades (direct or market) pass through the economy service. It validates: sender has the items/OMEN, receiver has space, no duplicated items, correct tax deduction |
| **Transaction Atomicity** | Every economy operation is a PostgreSQL transaction. Either the full trade completes (items move AND OMEN moves) or nothing happens. No partial states |
| **Audit Log** | Every transaction is logged with: timestamp, participants, items/amounts, source (market/trade/quest/loot/craft), result. Queryable for investigation |
| **Rate Limiting** | Per-player limits on economy operations (max 60 trades/min, max 100 market orders/min). Prevents bot-driven market manipulation |

#### Blockchain Bridge (Future Module)

The economy service is designed with a clean **asset ownership interface** that can be backed by either the PostgreSQL ledger (default) or a blockchain backend.

| Layer | Interface | Current Implementation | Future Blockchain Implementation |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Currency** | `transfer(from, to, amount, currency)` | PostgreSQL ledger entry | On-chain token transfer |
| **Asset Ownership** | `ownerOf(assetId)`, `transfer(assetId, from, to)` | PostgreSQL ownership table | NFT ownership query / transfer |
| **Balance Query** | `balanceOf(playerId, currency)` | PostgreSQL aggregate query | On-chain balance check |
| **Transaction History** | `history(playerId, filters)` | PostgreSQL audit log | On-chain event log + off-chain index |
| **Minting** | `mint(assetType, metadata, owner)` | PostgreSQL insert | NFT mint to player wallet |

The blockchain bridge is an **optional module** — the game works fully without any chain. When/if enabled:
- Players link a crypto wallet to their account (optional)
- OMEN/NOVA can be withdrawn to on-chain tokens (with cooldown and fees to prevent market abuse)
- Ships/equipment can be minted as NFTs (cosmetic metadata + stats snapshot)
- The on-chain state is a **mirror** of the authoritative server state, not the source of truth. Server always wins in case of conflict

---

### Persistence Layer

#### PostgreSQL (Primary Database)

All persistent game data lives in PostgreSQL. Chosen for ACID transactions (critical for economy), complex query support (market orders, leaderboards, analytics), and mature tooling.

| Data Domain | Tables (Conceptual) | Access Pattern |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Player Accounts** | `players`, `sessions`, `auth_tokens`, `settings` | Read on login, update on settings change. Low write volume |
| **Player State** | `ships`, `inventory`, `equipment`, `skills`, `quests`, `reputation` | Read on zone entry, write on state change. Medium write volume — batched every 5 seconds per player |
| **Economy** | `omen_ledger`, `nova_ledger`, `market_orders`, `trade_history`, `audit_log` | High write volume — every transaction. Append-only ledger tables. Market orders are hot tables (frequent insert/update/delete) |
| **World State** | `zones`, `resource_nodes`, `npc_state`, `conquest_territory`, `guild_structures` | Read on zone server startup, periodic flush. Medium write volume |
| **Social** | `friends`, `guilds`, `guild_members`, `guild_bank`, `chat_log` | Read on login, write on social actions. Low-medium write volume |
| **Analytics** | `events`, `sessions`, `economy_snapshots` | Write-heavy, append-only. Archived to cold storage after 90 days |

#### Write Optimization

| Strategy | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Batched Writes** | Non-critical state changes (player position, HP) are batched and flushed to DB every **5 seconds** per zone server. If a server crashes, max 5 seconds of position/HP state is lost (acceptable — players respawn) |
| **Synchronous Economy Writes** | OMEN/NOVA transfers, market trades, and item transfers are written to DB synchronously within a transaction BEFORE the server confirms to the client. No fire-and-forget for money |
| **Connection Pooling** | PgBouncer or equivalent connection pooler in front of PostgreSQL. Game servers share a pool rather than each holding dedicated connections |
| **Read Replicas** | Leaderboards, market price history, analytics queries, and other read-heavy workloads run against read replicas — never touch the primary |
| **Partitioning** | Ledger tables partitioned by month. Audit logs partitioned by week. Old partitions archived to cold storage |

#### Redis (Cache & Real-Time State)

Redis handles ephemeral, high-frequency data that doesn't need the durability of PostgreSQL.

| Use Case | Data | TTL |
|----------|------|-----|
| **Session Cache** | Player session tokens, current zone, connection state | 24 hours (refreshed on activity) |
| **Leaderboard** | Sorted sets for various rankings (OMEN earned, PvP kills, mining output) | Rebuilt every 5 minutes from DB |
| **Rate Limiting** | Per-player action counters (trades/min, messages/min, login attempts) | Rolling window, 1–5 minute TTL |
| **Zone Population** | Current player count per zone (for instancing decisions and UI display) | Updated every tick, 30 second TTL |
| **Market Price Cache** | Recent trade prices for quick display (avoids hitting DB on every market screen open) | 30 seconds |
| **Pub/Sub** | Cross-server messaging: guild chat, friend online notifications, system announcements | N/A (ephemeral) |

---

### Scaling Strategy

Designed to grow from launch (1K–5K CCU) to mature (100K+ CCU) without architectural changes — only infrastructure additions.

#### Launch Configuration (1K–5K CCU)

| Component | Instances | Specs |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Load Balancer** | 1 | Cloud-managed (ALB/NLB equivalent) |
| **Gateway Servers** | 2–3 | 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM each |
| **Zone Servers** | 4–8 | 4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM each. Each handles 5–10 zones |
| **Economy Service** | 2 (active-standby) | 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM. Hot standby for failover |
| **Shared Services** | 2–3 | Chat, friends, guild, matchmaking. Can share instances at this scale |
| **PostgreSQL** | 1 primary + 1 read replica | 4 vCPU, 16 GB RAM, SSD storage |
| **Redis** | 1 instance | 2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM |
| **Region** | 1 (closest to primary player base) | Add second region when latency complaints emerge |

**Estimated Monthly Cost:** $1,500–$3,000/mo at launch scale (cloud-dependent).

#### Growth Configuration (10K–50K CCU)

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Gateways** | Scale to 10–15 instances behind load balancer |
| **Zone Servers** | Scale to 20–40 instances. Hot zones (popular areas) get dedicated servers |
| **Economy Service** | Scale to 3–4 active instances with queue-based write distribution |
| **PostgreSQL** | Upgrade to 8+ vCPU, 32+ GB RAM. Add 2–3 read replicas. Enable connection pooling |
| **Redis** | Cluster mode (3+ nodes) for high availability |
| **Regions** | 2–3 regions (e.g., US, EU, Asia). Players connect to nearest gateway. All regions share one DB (single shard universe) with region-aware replication |
| **CDN** | Add CDN for asset delivery (game updates, voxel asset bundles) |

#### Mature Configuration (100K+ CCU)

| Change | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Zone Servers** | 100+ instances. Auto-scaling based on zone population. Conquest zones get temporary high-spec instances during battles |
| **PostgreSQL** | Vertically scaled primary (16+ vCPU, 64+ GB RAM). 5+ read replicas. Consider Citus or similar for horizontal scaling of analytics/ledger tables |
| **Economy Service** | Dedicated cluster with its own DB connection pool. Queue-based architecture to handle trade spikes |
| **Global Routing** | Anycast or GeoDNS routing to nearest region. 4+ regions |
| **Monitoring** | Dedicated observability stack (metrics, logs, traces, alerting). Full-time on-call rotation |

---

### Latency Budget

Total input-to-visual-feedback target: **<200ms** for the 95th percentile player.

| Segment | Budget | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Client Input → WebSocket Send** | <10ms | Local processing. Immediate on modern phones |
| **Network (Client → Gateway)** | <50ms | Depends on player's ISP and distance to region. Target <50ms for same-region players |
| **Gateway → Zone Server** | <5ms | Internal network, same datacenter |
| **Server Tick Processing** | <50ms | One full tick cycle (20 Hz). Worst case: input arrives just after a tick, waits up to 50ms |
| **Zone Server → Gateway** | <5ms | Internal network |
| **Network (Gateway → Client)** | <50ms | Same as inbound |
| **Client Rendering** | <33ms | One frame at 30 FPS |
| **Total** | <203ms | Within budget. Client-side prediction makes it feel faster |

#### Client-Side Prediction

Even though the server is authoritative, the client uses **prediction** for responsive feel:

| Predicted (Client) | Authoritative (Server) |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Ship movement and turning | Final position (server corrects if >threshold drift) |
| Weapon fire animation / SFX | Hit detection, damage calculation, kill confirmation |
| UI interactions (menu open, button press) | Trade execution, craft result, OMEN/NOVA balance |
| Shield/armor bar animation (optimistic) | Actual HP values (corrected on next server update) |
| Resource node "harvesting" animation | Actual resource yield, inventory update |

If the server's authoritative state disagrees with the client's prediction, the client **snaps to server state** with a smooth interpolation (no teleporting). For economy operations, the client shows a "pending" state until server confirms — never shows optimistic OMEN/NOVA changes.

---

### Failover & Recovery

| Failure | Recovery |
|---------|----------|
| **Gateway crash** | Load balancer routes new connections to healthy gateways. Existing clients on crashed gateway reconnect automatically (60-second session hold on zone server) |
| **Zone server crash** | Zone goes offline for 5–15 seconds while a replacement instance loads zone state from DB. Players in the zone see a "reconnecting" message. Max 5 seconds of position/HP state lost (last batch flush). Economy state is never lost (synchronous writes) |
| **Economy service crash** | Hot standby takes over within seconds. In-flight transactions are rolled back (PostgreSQL transaction guarantee). Clients retry automatically |
| **PostgreSQL primary crash** | Read replica promoted to primary (automated failover). 5–30 second downtime depending on replication lag. All writes during failover are queued and replayed |
| **Redis crash** | Cache is rebuilt from DB on restart. Session tokens re-validated. Leaderboards regenerated. 30–60 seconds of degraded performance, no data loss |
| **Full region outage** | Players routed to secondary region. Higher latency but playable. Single-shard DB means economy continuity is maintained |

---

### Technical Targets

#### Client Performance

| Target | Spec |
|--------|------|

## Anti-Cheat & Security

Odyssey's player-driven economy (finite 1B OMEN supply, real-money NOVA currency), full-loot PvP zones, guild banks, and territory conquest create massive incentives for exploitation. Every system that touches OMEN, NOVA, items, or competitive outcomes must be hardened against cheating, duplication, market manipulation, and unauthorized access. This section defines the security architecture, detection systems, and response protocols the dev team must implement.

---

### Server Authority Model

The server is the single source of truth for all game state that affects the economy, combat outcomes, or player progression. The client is a rendering and input layer — it can **request** actions but never **execute** them unilaterally.

#### Server-Authoritative Systems

| System | Server Responsibility | Client Role |
|--------|----------------------|-------------|
| **OMEN Balances** | Stores, validates, and mutates all balances | Displays cached balance; sends spend/transfer requests |
| **NOVA Balances** | Tracks purchases, validates against payment processor | Displays balance; sends purchase/exchange requests |
| **Inventory** | Owns item database; validates all add/remove/move operations | Renders inventory UI; sends equip/unequip/drop requests |
| **Market Orders** | Processes order matching, fee deduction, escrow | Submits order parameters; renders order book |
| **Combat Resolution** | Calculates all damage, hit detection, death, loot drops | Sends fire/ability inputs; renders combat effects |
| **Crafting** | Validates materials, rolls success/failure, creates items | Sends craft requests; renders progress bar |
| **Guild Bank** | Enforces permissions, caps, logs all transactions | Sends deposit/withdraw requests; renders transaction log |
| **Territory Control** | Tracks War Points, runs Conquest Battles, assigns ownership | Sends WP-earning action results; renders territory map |
| **Skill Progression** | Calculates EXP gains, validates tier unlocks | Sends action completions; renders skill tree |
| **Resource Nodes** | Spawns nodes, tracks depletion, validates extraction yields | Sends mining inputs; renders extraction effects |
| **Singularity Orbs** | Validates 1,000,000 OMEN compression, tracks all 1,000 max Orbs | Sends compress/destroy requests; renders Orb visuals |

#### Client-Trusted Systems (with Server Validation)

| System | Client Authority | Server Validation |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Movement Prediction** | Client-side interpolation for responsiveness | Server validates position deltas against max speed per ship size; rejects impossible movement |
| **Camera / View** | Full client control | None (no gameplay impact) |
| **Cosmetic Rendering** | Local rendering of owned skins | Server confirms skin ownership before transmitting to other clients |
| **Chat Input** | Client composes messages | Server enforces rate limits, filters, link blocking |
| **UI / HUD Layout** | Full client control | None (no gameplay impact) |

**Key Principle:** No economic mutation — OMEN transfer, NOVA exchange, item creation, market order, guild bank operation, or crafting action — ever originates from the client as a completed fact. The client sends a **request** with parameters; the server independently validates preconditions, executes the action, and returns the authoritative result.

---

### Economy Security

#### Transaction Validation

Every economic action must satisfy all of the following before execution:

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Balance Sufficiency** | Sender has ≥ requested amount (OMEN, NOVA, or items) at time of execution |
| **Atomicity** | Transaction completes fully or rolls back entirely — no partial state |
| **Idempotency** | Duplicate requests (same ID, same parameters) are rejected, not re-executed |
| **Double-Spend Prevention** | Funds are locked (reserved) at request time; concurrent requests against the same balance are serialized |
| **Audit Trail** | Every mutation records: timestamp, actor, action, before-state, after-state, request ID |
| **Rollback Safety** | All transactions can be reversed by an admin tool within the audit window |

#### Market Order Protections

| Protection | Implementation |
|------------|---------------|
| **Escrow** | OMEN/items are moved to escrow on order creation; returned if order is cancelled or expires |
| **Price Validation** | Buy/sell orders rejected if price exceeds **10× the 24-hour rolling average** for that item — prevents wash trading and price manipulation |
| **Quantity Limits** | Single order capped at **10,000 units** for common resources, **100 units** for T6+ equipment |
| **Server-Side Fees** | Market fees (1–5% depending on city) deducted by the server at settlement, never by the client |
| **Order Rate Limiting** | Max **100 create/cancel operations per hour** per account (see Rate Limiting section) |
| **Cross-Market Isolation** | Orders placed at one city are not visible/fillable at another (matches per-city storage model) |

#### Direct Trade Protections

| Protection | Implementation |
|------------|---------------|
| **Two-Stage Confirmation** | Both players must confirm trade contents independently; any modification resets both confirmations |
| **Escrow Lock** | Items and OMEN move to escrow on first confirmation; **30-second timeout** — if second confirmation doesn't arrive, escrow returns to owners |
| **Anti-Scam Flags** | Server flags trades where NOVA:OMEN ratio deviates >**300%** from the current market rate; flagged trades require a secondary confirmation ("This trade is significantly below/above market rate. Are you sure?") |
| **New Account Restrictions** | Accounts younger than **7 days** cannot initiate direct trades involving >**10,000 OMEN** or any T5+ equipment |
| **Trade Logging** | All direct trades are logged with full item/currency details for audit review |

#### Item Duplication Prevention

| Vector | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| **Craft Duplication** | Materials are **locked** (removed from inventory) at craft start, not on completion — failed crafts return partial materials server-side |
| **Transfer Duplication** | Items are removed from sender's inventory **before** being added to recipient's; network failure during transfer triggers rollback to sender |
| **Simultaneous Use** | Items can only exist in one context at a time (equipped OR in inventory OR in market OR in guild bank OR in escrow — never multiple) |
| **Ghost Items** | Server runs periodic inventory reconciliation — any item ID that exists in multiple locations triggers an alert and quarantines all copies |
| **Death Loot Duplication** | Wreck loot container is generated server-side with a unique ID; loot is removed from the dead player's inventory atomically before the container spawns |

#### Guild Bank Security

| Protection | Implementation |
|------------|---------------|
| **Permission Enforcement** | Only Guild Master and Officers (max 5) can withdraw; Veterans and below can deposit only — enforced server-side regardless of client state |
| **Daily Withdrawal Caps** | Guild Master sets per-Officer daily OMEN withdrawal cap (enforced server-side); resets at 00:00 UTC |
| **Concurrent Access** | Guild bank operations are serialized per guild — no two operations execute simultaneously |
| **Full Audit Log** | Every deposit, withdrawal, and cap change is logged with actor, timestamp, amount, and running balance — visible to all guild members |
| **Dissolution Protection** | Guild disbanding requires **72-hour cooldown** with member notification; bank contents distributed proportionally or transferred to successor |

#### Currency Integrity Monitoring

**Real-Time Alerts** (trigger investigation within 15 minutes):

| Alert | Condition | Severity |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Whale Balance | Any account holds >**10,000,000 OMEN** | Medium |
| Rapid Accumulation | Any account gains >**100,000 OMEN/hour** from non-market sources | High |
| Negative Balance | Any OMEN or NOVA balance drops below **0** | Critical |
| Orb Anomaly | Singularity Orb count exceeds **1,000** or Orb exists without corresponding 1,000,000 OMEN lock | Critical |
| Supply Drift | Total circulating OMEN + compressed OMEN ≠ **1,000,000,000** | Critical |

**Daily Audits** (automated, reviewed by ops team):

| Audit | Validation |
|-------|-----------|
| **OMEN Supply** | Total OMEN in circulation + OMEN locked in Singularity Orbs + OMEN in escrow + OMEN in guild banks = **1,000,000,000** exactly |
| **NOVA Reconciliation** | Total NOVA across all accounts = total purchased via payment processor − total spent on non-transferable items (battle pass, cosmetics consumed) |
| **Item Census** | Total items in existence matches cumulative (crafted + looted + quest-rewarded) − (destroyed + lost on death + deconstructed) |

#### NOVA / Real-Money Protections

| Protection | Implementation |
|------------|---------------|
| **Payment Verification** | NOVA is only credited after payment processor confirms settlement (not on charge initiation) |
| **Chargeback Flagging** | If a chargeback occurs, all NOVA trades made by that account within the prior **48 hours** are flagged for review; account is suspended until resolved |
| **Fraud Detection** | Purchases from >3 different payment methods in 24 hours, or >**$500 USD** in a single day, trigger manual review |
| **RMT Detection** | Repeated one-sided trades (OMEN/items for nothing in return) between the same accounts are flagged as potential real-money trading |
| **RMT Sanctions** | First offense: 7-day trade ban + warning. Second offense: 30-day ban. Third offense: permanent ban with OMEN/item seizure |

---

### Combat Integrity

#### Hit Validation

All weapon fire is validated server-side before damage is applied:

| Check | Validation Rule |
|-------|----------------|
| **Position Verification** | Server compares attacker and target positions at time of fire; rejects hits where server-side positions diverge by >**15%** from client-reported positions |
| **Range Check** | Weapon range enforced per weapon type (Short/Medium/Long/Very Long) with **±5% tolerance** for network latency |
| **Line of Sight** | Server performs simplified LOS check — projectiles cannot pass through planetary bodies, stations, or large asteroids |
| **Cooldown Enforcement** | Server tracks weapon fire timestamps; shots faster than the weapon's fire rate are silently dropped |
| **Ammo Consumption** | For ammo-based weapons (Missiles, Torpedoes), server deducts ammo before applying damage; shots without ammo are rejected |

#### Damage Calculation

Damage is calculated **entirely server-side** — the client never influences damage numbers:

```
1. Base Damage       → weapon tier × weapon type base DPS
2. Type Effectiveness → apply damage type multiplier vs. target defense type
                        (Energy → strong vs. Shields, weak vs. Armor)
                        (Kinetic → strong vs. Armor, weak vs. Shields)
                        (Explosive → strong vs. Hull, weak vs. Shields)
                        (EMP → strong vs. Electronics, weak vs. Hull)
3. Critical Roll     → server RNG; crit chance based on attacker modules/skills
4. Module Modifiers  → damage bonuses/penalties from equipped modules
5. Defense Application:
   a. Shields absorb first (if active) → reduce by shield resistance
   b. Armor absorbs next → reduce by armor resistance
   c. Hull takes remainder → 0 HP = destruction
```

All random rolls (critical hits, crafting success, loot drops) use a **server-side CSPRNG** — the client has no visibility into the RNG seed or state.

#### Movement Validation

| Check | Rule | Flag Threshold |
|-------|------|----------------|
| **Velocity Cap** | Max velocity enforced per ship size (XS = Very Fast, S = Fast, M = Medium, L = Slow, XL = Very Slow) based on equipped thruster stats | Exceeding max speed × **1.1** for >2 seconds |
| **Position Delta** | Server compares client-reported position against predicted position (last known position + velocity × time) | Delta > max speed × elapsed time × **1.15** |
| **Acceleration** | Acceleration rate capped by thruster module specs | Acceleration exceeds thruster max × **1.1** |
| **Anti-Teleport** | Flag any position jump >**500 meters** in a single tick without a valid warp gate or jump drive event | Immediate flag + position correction |
| **Warp Validation** | Warp/jump events validated against warp gate proximity, jump drive cooldown, and fuel consumption | Invalid warp = position reset to last valid location |

Flagged movement triggers server-side position correction (rubber-banding). Repeated flags (>**10 in 5 minutes**) escalate to automated investigation.

#### Zone Boundary Enforcement

| Rule | Implementation |
|------|---------------|
| **Friendly Zone** | PvP damage packets in Friendly zones are **silently dropped** — no damage applied, no notification to attacker |
| **Mild Zone (Unflagged)** | Damage against unflagged players in Mild zones is rejected; flagging status is server-authoritative |
| **Zone Transition** | Zone type is determined by server-side position, not client-reported zone — prevents "zone spoofing" to avoid PvP penalties |
| **Death Penalty Enforcement** | Loot drops on death are calculated server-side per zone rules (Friendly = none, Mild PvP = cargo only, Full = cargo + all modules, Hardcore = total loss including ship hull) |

#### Death & Loot Validation

| Step | Server Action |
|------|--------------|
| **Death Determination** | Server confirms hull HP = 0; records cause of death (PvP kill, PvE, environmental) |
| **Loot Calculation** | Server applies zone-specific drop rules; generates loot manifest |
| **Wreck Spawning** | Server creates wreck container with unique ID at death location; wreck persists for **10 minutes** |
| **Loot Priority** | Killer gets **5-second exclusive loot window**; after 5s, wreck is open to all players in range |
| **Inventory Removal** | Dropped items are atomically removed from the dead player's inventory before wreck container is populated |
| **Respawn** | Server assigns respawn location (same spot for Friendly, nearest major city for Mild/Full/Hardcore); Hardcore deaths assign backup ship or free T1 XS Shuttle |
| **Repair Cost** | Server calculates repair cost based on ship size and zone multiplier (1× Friendly, 2× Mild PvP, 3× Full, N/A Hardcore) |
| **Death Replay** | Server records the last **30 seconds** of combat data (positions, damage events, abilities used) for the dead player's review — aids in cheat reporting |

---

### Anti-Cheat Systems

#### Memory Tampering Detection

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Binary Signature Verification** | Client binary hash is verified against known-good signatures at launch and periodically during session |
| **Periodic Memory Scans** | Client-side anti-cheat module scans for known cheat tool signatures, injected DLLs, and modified game memory regions |
| **Code Injection Detection** | Monitors for unauthorized code loaded into the game process (hooking, DLL injection, function patching) |
| **Debugger Detection** | Detects attached debuggers, memory inspectors, and breakpoints — flags account for review |

All client-side detections are **supplementary** — the server authority model is the primary defense. Client-side anti-cheat catches cheaters faster but is not relied upon for security.

#### Packet Manipulation Prevention

| Protection | Implementation |
|------------|---------------|
| **Sequence Numbers** | Every client→server packet includes an incrementing sequence number; out-of-order or missing packets trigger re-sync and logging |
| **Timing Validation** | Server tracks packet timing; packets arriving faster than physically possible (sub-millisecond bursts) are flagged |
| **Structure Validation** | Packets are validated against expected schema; malformed packets are dropped and logged |
| **Encryption** | All client↔server traffic is encrypted (TLS 1.3 minimum); prevents packet sniffing and man-in-the-middle injection |

#### Modded Client Detection

The server watches for behavioral signatures that indicate a modified client:

| Signal | Detection Method | Response |
|--------|-----------------|----------|
| **Impossible Values** | Client reports damage, speed, or resource yields exceeding server-calculated maximums | Silent flag; server uses its own values |
| **Unauthorized Data Requests** | Client requests data it shouldn't have access to (other player inventories, hidden node locations, server RNG state) | Request denied; account flagged |
| **Bot-Like Response Times** | Consistent sub-human reaction times (<50ms) across hundreds of actions | Behavioral analysis queue |
| **Non-Human Packet Patterns** | Perfectly regular packet timing, zero variance in input patterns, inhuman precision | Behavioral analysis queue |
| **Wallhack Detection** | Client requests rendering data for objects that should be occluded by server-side visibility checks | Flag + visibility data restricted |

Confirmed modded clients are placed in a **shadowban** pool: the player can still play but is matchmade only with other flagged accounts, market orders are deprioritized, and their actions are logged at maximum detail for evidence gathering before a formal ban.

#### Bot Detection

| Bot Type | Detection Methods | Threshold |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| **Mining Bots** | Identical extraction patterns repeated >**50 times** without variation; mining during impossible hours (24/7 with no breaks); pathing to nodes not yet visible on client | >8 hours continuous mining with <5% route variation |
| **Trading Bots** | Order placement faster than UI interaction allows; pattern-matched buy-low-sell-high across multiple markets within seconds; >**500 market actions/hour** | >200 market actions/hour with >90% profit rate |
| **Combat Bots** | Perfect dodge timing, frame-perfect weapon switching, zero input variation across engagements; farming the same NPC spawn with identical kill patterns | >100 identical engagement patterns in 24 hours |
| **Pathing Bots** | Movement along mathematically perfect paths (zero deviation from optimal route); instant course corrections; no collision avoidance variation | Route deviation <**1%** across >20 repetitions |

**Bot Mitigation Escalation:**

| Stage | Action | Trigger |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Behavioral CAPTCHA** | First flag — present an in-game interaction challenge (e.g., "dock at this station" with a randomized approach vector) |
| 2 | **Rate Limiting** | Second flag within 24h — reduce action rates to 50% of normal caps |
| 3 | **Behavioral Fingerprinting** | Ongoing — build a behavioral profile; compare against known bot signatures using ML classifier |
| 4 | **Delayed Ban Wave** | Confirmed bots are not banned immediately — bans are issued in **weekly waves** to prevent bot developers from identifying exact detection triggers |

---

### Account Security

#### Authentication

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Password Requirements** | Minimum 10 characters, at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number, 1 special character; checked against breached password databases |
| **Two-Factor Authentication** | Optional by default; **mandatory** for accounts holding >**1,000 NOVA** or >**1,000,000 OMEN** |
| **2FA Method** | TOTP-based (compatible with Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.) |
| **Backup Codes** | 10 single-use backup codes generated at 2FA enrollment; stored hashed server-side |
| **Recovery** | Account recovery requires email verification + support ticket with identity verification; 72-hour cooldown on recovery actions |

#### Session Management

| Rule | Implementation |
|------|---------------|
| **Single Session** | Maximum **1 active game session** per account at any time; new login terminates the previous session |
| **Session Expiry** | Sessions expire after **24 hours** of continuous use; re-authentication required |
| **Idle Timeout** | Sessions are suspended after **30 minutes** of no input; character is safely docked or despawned |
| **Token Binding** | Session tokens are bound to device fingerprint + IP address; token reuse from a different device/IP is rejected and triggers a security alert |
| **Secure Token Storage** | Tokens stored in platform-secure storage (iOS Keychain, Android Keystore); never persisted in plaintext |

#### Device Binding

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **New Device Notification** | Login from an unrecognized device triggers an email notification with device details and location |
| **Trusted Device Limit** | Maximum **3 trusted devices** per account; adding a 4th requires removing an existing one |
| **Device Fingerprinting** | Combines hardware ID, OS version, screen resolution, and installed fonts; stored as a hash |
| **Suspicious Device Flagging** | Devices associated with previously banned accounts are flagged; login from flagged devices triggers enhanced verification |

#### Suspicious Login Detection

| Pattern | Automated Action |
|---------|-----------------|
| **New Country** | Login from a country not seen in the last 90 days → email verification required before session is granted |
| **VPN / Proxy** | Login from known VPN/proxy IP ranges → CAPTCHA challenge + email notification |
| **Failed Attempts** | 5 failed login attempts in 10 minutes → account locked for **30 minutes**; 15 failed in 1 hour → locked for **24 hours** + email alert |
| **Long Inactive** | First login after >**90 days** of inactivity → email verification + mandatory password review prompt |
| **Banned Device Association** | Device fingerprint matches a previously banned account → login blocked; manual support review required |
| **Impossible Travel** | Login from two locations >**500 km apart** within **1 hour** → second session terminated; email verification required |

---

### Exploit Response Protocol

#### Severity Tiers

| Severity | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **Critical** | <**1 hour** | OMEN duplication, NOVA generation without payment, Singularity Orb exploit, server-wide item duplication, authentication bypass |
| **High** | <**4 hours** | Market manipulation allowing guaranteed profit, guild bank unauthorized access, combat damage exploit (infinite damage), zone boundary bypass (PvP in Friendly zones) |
| **Medium** | <**24 hours** | Minor item duplication (limited scope), speed hacking, resource yield manipulation, trade scam exploits |
| **Low** | <**7 days** | Cosmetic exploits, UI manipulation, non-economic exploits, minor information leaks |

#### Triage Procedure

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1. **Disable** | Immediately disable the affected system (e.g., disable market trading, lock crafting, pause guild bank operations) — announce maintenance via in-game banner |
| 2. **Announce** | Post downtime notice in-game, on social media, and on the official site with estimated duration (do not disclose exploit details) |
| 3. **Investigate** | Identify root cause using server logs, audit trails, and affected account activity; determine exploit entry point and scope |
| 4. **Impact Assessment** | Quantify: how much OMEN/NOVA was generated or duplicated, how many accounts are affected, how long the exploit was active |

#### Exploiter Categorization & Sanctions

| Category | Definition | Sanctions |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Innocent** | Used exploit unknowingly once or twice (e.g., got unexpected extra items from a bugged trade) | Items/OMEN removed; no punishment; explanatory email sent |
| **Opportunist** | Noticed the exploit and used it a handful of times (3–10 uses) before reporting or stopping | Items/OMEN removed; **3-day suspension** + formal warning |
| **Abuser** | Deliberately exploited repeatedly (10+ uses) for personal gain without reporting | Full rollback of gained assets; **30-day ban**; placed on watch list for 90 days |
| **Distributor** | Shared exploit instructions with others or sold exploit services | Full rollback; **permanent ban**; associated accounts investigated; legal action considered for financial damage exceeding **$10,000 USD** |

#### Rollback Procedures

**When to Rollback:**
- Exploited OMEN exceeds **100,000,000** (100M) OR
- More than **10%** of active player accounts are affected OR
- Exploit duration was less than **6 hours** (clean rollback feasible)

**Rollback Scope Options:**

| Scope | When Used | Method |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Transaction-Specific** | Small number of accounts, clear exploit transactions | Reverse specific transactions from audit log; restore pre-exploit balances |
| **Targeted Account** | Identified exploiter accounts (<100 accounts) | Roll back all account state to pre-exploit snapshot; legitimate concurrent activity reviewed case-by-case |
| **Full Server** | Widespread exploitation affecting economy integrity, <6h duration | Restore full server state from last clean snapshot; **all player progress during the window is lost** — compensation issued (NOVA credits + XP boost) |

**Communication Protocol:**
1. Announce rollback scope and reason within **1 hour** of decision
2. Provide exact time window affected
3. Detail compensation for legitimate players impacted by rollback
4. Publish post-mortem within **72 hours**

#### Post-Resolution

| Action | Timeline |
|--------|----------|
| **Patch** | Hotfix deployed within **24 hours** of root cause identification; if complex, temporary mitigation (system disable) remains until fix ships |
| **Ban Wave** | Exploiter bans issued **48–72 hours** after patch (delay prevents revealing detection methods) |
| **Internal Post-Mortem** | Written within **5 business days**; covers root cause, timeline, impact, response evaluation, and prevention measures |
| **Public Transparency Blog** | Published within **7 days** for Medium+ severity exploits; describes what happened (without technical exploit details), actions taken, and preventive measures |
| **Bug Bounty Rewards** | Players who responsibly reported the exploit receive rewards |

**Bug Bounty Reward Table:**

| Severity | Reward |
|----------|--------|
| **Critical** | **10,000 NOVA** + exclusive "Guardian" title + unique ship skin |
| **High** | **2,500 NOVA** + "Warden" title |
| **Medium** | **500 NOVA** |
| **Low** | **100 NOVA** |

Rewards are only issued for **responsible disclosure** — reports submitted through the official bug bounty portal without public disclosure or personal exploitation.

---

### Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention

#### Per-Player Rate Limits

| Action | Soft Cap (warning) | Hard Cap (blocked) | Reset Period |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Market Orders** (create + cancel) | 80/hr | 100/hr | Rolling 1 hour |
| **Crafting Actions** | 400/hr | 500/hr | Rolling 1 hour |
| **Guild Bank Withdrawals** | 8/hr | 10/hr | Rolling 1 hour |
| **Direct Trades** | 15/hr | 20/hr | Rolling 1 hour |
| **Chat Messages** | 25/min | 30/min | Rolling 1 minute |
| **Resource Extraction** | 1,500 units/hr | 2,000 units/hr | Rolling 1 hour |
| **NOVA Purchases** | 4/hr | 5/hr | Rolling 1 hour |
| **Trade Requests Sent** | 10/hr | 15/hr | Rolling 1 hour |
| **Market Listing Cancels** | 30/hr | 50/hr | Rolling 1 hour |
| **Fleet Commands** | 40/hr | 60/hr | Rolling 1 hour |

Hitting a **soft cap** displays a warning ("You're performing this action very frequently. Slow down to avoid being rate limited.") and logs the event. Hitting a **hard cap** blocks the action for the remainder of the reset period and flags the account for bot detection review.

#### Action Throttling

Server-enforced cooldowns that prevent exploiting game mechanics through rapid inputs:

| Action | Minimum Interval | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|-------|
| **Weapon Fire** | Per weapon fire rate stat | Cannot exceed equipped weapon's stated fire rate; server drops excess fire packets |
| **Module Activation** | Per module cooldown stat | Cooldown tracked server-side; early activation attempts silently rejected |
| **Fleet Undock** | **5 seconds** between undock commands | Prevents rapid dock/undock cycling for invulnerability |
| **Warp Gate Use** | **10 seconds** between warps | Prevents warp spam; fuel consumed server-side |
| **Docking** | **3 seconds** between dock requests | Prevents dock-spam griefing at stations |
| **Skill Respec** | **24 hours** between respecs | Prevents constant respeccing to game different content |
| **Guild Invite** | **5 seconds** between invites sent | Prevents invite spam |

#### Spam Prevention

| Category | Protection | Implementation |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Chat Frequency** | Max **30 messages/minute** (hard cap) | Exceeding = 5-minute chat mute; repeated = escalating mutes (15 min, 1 hr, 24 hr) |
| **Duplicate Messages** | Identical messages within **60 seconds** are blocked | Only first instance delivered; sender sees a "message already sent" notice |
| **Link Blocking** | URLs in chat are blocked by default | Whitelisted domains only (official site, official Discord); others replaced with "[link removed]" |
| **Market Listing Spam** | Listing and immediately cancelling the same item >**5 times in 10 minutes** triggers a **30-minute market cooldown** | Prevents UI spam in the order book |
| **Trade Request Spam** | >**3 declined trade requests** to the same player in 1 hour = **1-hour trade block** to that player | Prevents harassment via trade window |
| **Mail Spam** | Max **10 mails/hour** to unique recipients; max **3 mails/hour** to the same recipient | Exceeding = mail system locked for 1 hour |
| **Broadcast Spam** | Guild/faction broadcast messages limited to Officers+ with **5-minute cooldown** | Prevents notification fatigue |

## Storylines

Storylines are structured quest chains that follow a narrative arc while teaching game systems. They serve as an extended tutorial — each act introduces new mechanics through story-driven missions so players learn by doing, not by reading.

Players are never forced into storylines. They can ignore them and freeplay at any time. But the storylines offer the best rewards for their tier and always leave the player better equipped for the open world.

---

### Main Storyline: The Shepherd's Path

*"Follow the signal. Find the truth."*

The central narrative follows the mystery of the **Shepherd Signal** — the transmission that led humanity to the Cradle Stars. Who sent it? Why? And what does it have to do with the Absent Ones, Banx Station, and the sealed Breach?

The story spans five acts, each set in a different system, each teaching a major game pillar.

### Storyline Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Never block freeplay** | Storylines are always optional. Players can pause and return anytime |
| **Teach by doing** | Every quest teaches a mechanic by requiring the player to use it, not by explaining it in text |
| **Reward generously** | Storyline rewards are the best available for their tier — incentivizing completion |
| **Scale with the player** | If a player out-levels a storyline, enemies and challenges scale up (but rewards stay appropriate) |
| **No dead ends** | If a player fails a quest, they can retry. No permanent failure states in storylines |
| **Meaningful choices** | Act 3's faction choice and Act 4's branching paths create replay value |
| **Lore is earned** | The deepest secrets (Singularity, Breach, Absent Ones) are revealed through gameplay, not cutscenes |
| **Companion bonds** | Thessik and Grukk develop over the story — players feel invested in their fates |

## New Player Experience — Detailed Walkthrough

The New Player Experience is **Act 1 of The Shepherd's Path**. There is no separate tutorial — the story IS the tutorial. Below is a beat-by-beat walkthrough of everything the player experiences.

---

### Chapter 1.1 — Awakening (~3 min)

*The cinematic ends. The camera is now inside the cockpit. The player has control.*

**What the player sees:**
- Cockpit view. Cracks in the windshield. Sparks from a damaged console
- Uurf fills the lower half of the screen — blue-green, cloud-streaked
- HUD is flickering. Most elements are offline (greyed out)
- Only the emergency thrust indicator and a pulsing beacon marker are active
- Ship is drifting slowly, rotating slightly

**Beat 1 — First Input**
```
HUD prompt (bottom center):
  ⚠ EMERGENCY — Hull integrity: 34%
  Use LEFT STICK to steer toward the beacon signal.
                                        [Got it]
```
- Player taps "Got it" — prompt disappears
- Left stick appears on screen. Player pushes it
- The ship responds sluggishly (damaged thrusters)
- The beacon marker (diamond icon) pulses on the HUD — player steers toward it

**Beat 2 — Thrust Control**
- After 5 seconds of steering, a new prompt fades in (no popup — just HUD text):
```
HUD hint (top center, fades after 8s):
  RIGHT STICK controls camera. Look around your ship.
```
- Player experiments with camera. Can see the hull damage, Uurf below, stars above
- The beacon is getting closer — a small automated relay buoy in orbit

**Beat 3 — Reaching the Beacon**
- Player reaches the beacon (within 50m triggers it)
- The buoy flashes. Ship systems partially reboot
- **HUD comes online piece by piece** (satisfying UI animation):
  - Speed indicator → appears
  - Altitude → appears
  - Fuel gauge → appears (showing 42%)
  - Cargo indicator → appears (0/50)
  - Scanner → stays offline (damaged)
  - Weapons → stays offline (damaged)

**Beat 4 — Kael's Voice**
- Radio crackles. NPC voice line:
> *"Unidentified shuttle, this is Kael at Uurf Landing. You're leaking fuel and your vector's got you skimming atmo in about ninety seconds. I'm lighting up pad 7 — steer for the green marker and try not to die."*
- A green waypoint marker appears on the planet surface below
- The HUD shows a new objective:
```
  OBJECTIVE: Land at Uurf Landing — Pad 7
  Distance: 12.4 km ↓
```

### Chapter 1.2 — Rough Landing (~3 min)

**What the player experiences:**
- Ship enters Uurf's atmosphere. Screen edges glow orange (re-entry heat)
- Ship shakes — haptic feedback pulses
- Controls get looser as atmosphere thickens (transition from space to atmospheric flight)
- Terrain becomes visible below: green plains, scattered rock formations, a small settlement with landing pads

**Beat 1 — Atmospheric Flight**
```
HUD hint:
  Entering atmosphere. Ship handling will change.
  Pull BACK on LEFT STICK to slow descent.
```
- Player pulls back to brake. Ship slows. Nose comes up
- If the player descends too fast, Kael warns: *"Easy! Ease up on the throttle or you're gonna leave a crater."*
- Terrain avoidance isn't hard here — Verdant Plains are flat and forgiving

**Beat 2 — Approach Landing Pad**
- The green marker resolves into a visible landing pad — a lit square on the ground
- Kael: *"Looking better. Line up with the pad. When you're over it, reduce thrust to zero."*
```
HUD hint:
  Hover over the landing pad. Release LEFT STICK to cut thrust.
```
- Player hovers over the pad and releases
- Ship auto-lands (assisted landing for first time). Landing gear extends, ship settles with a thud
- Haptic feedback: solid impact. Dust particles kick up

**Beat 3 — First NPC Interaction**
- Camera transitions to third-person view outside the ship
- Kael approaches — a weathered human mechanic, grease-stained, friendly face
- Dialogue appears as a text overlay at the bottom of the screen (no separate dialogue screen — stays in-world):

> **Kael:** "Well, you made it in one piece. Barely. Let me take a look at— yeah, okay. Your hull's half gone, you've got no scanner, no weapons, and your mining laser's running on fumes. What'd you DO to this thing?"
>
> **[...]** *(player taps to continue)*
>
> **Kael:** "Look, I can fix her up, but I'm gonna need materials. Ferrite ore — there's deposits all over the plains. I'll show you how to pull it out of the ground. Come on."

- **Quest accepted** notification slides in from the side:
```
  NEW QUEST: Scrap and Survive
  Mine 30 Ferrite Ore from Verdant Plains
```

---

### Chapter 1.3 — Scrap and Survive (~5 min)

**Beat 1 — Boarding the Ship**
- Kael walks toward the plains. Player taps a prompt to re-board the ship:
```
HUD prompt:
  Tap to board your ship.
```
- Player boards. Back to cockpit view
- Kael's voice on comms: *"Fly out past the tree line. You'll see the ore deposits — reddish-brown rock formations. Can't miss 'em."*

**Beat 2 — First Flight on Surface**
- Player lifts off from the pad (thrust up)
- This is the first time flying in atmosphere with full (damaged) controls
- The world is open — Verdant Plains stretch out in every direction
- Ore deposits are visible: reddish-brown rock formations with a faint shimmer
- A HUD marker points to the nearest cluster: `Ferrite Deposit — 340m`

**Beat 3 — Mining Tutorial**
- Player flies to the deposit. When within 50m:
```
HUD hint:
  Hover near the deposit. TAP the MINING LASER button to extract.
```
- The mining laser button illuminates on the left side of the screen
- Player taps and holds — a beam fires from the ship to the rock face
- **Immediate feedback:**
  - Rock fragments break off (particles)
  - Cargo counter ticks up: `Ferrite Ore: 1... 2... 3...`
  - A satisfying chime on each unit collected
  - The deposit visually depletes (bright → dull)

**Beat 4 — Heat Management (taught naturally)**
- After ~10 seconds of continuous mining, the laser heat gauge (small bar near the mining button) fills to yellow
- Kael: *"Watch your heat — fire in bursts or you'll burn out the emitter."*
```
HUD hint:
  Mining laser overheating. Release to cool down.
```
- Player releases. Heat drops. Player learns the burst rhythm naturally
- If the player ignores it and overheats: laser cuts out for 3 seconds, Kael sighs: *"Told ya."*

**Beat 5 — Fill the Quota**
- Player mines across 2-3 deposits to reach 30 Ferrite Ore
- During this time they're practicing: flying, hovering, aiming the laser, managing heat, watching cargo fill
- This is the core loop in miniature — and it feels good already
- Quest updates: `Ferrite Ore: 30/30 — Return to Kael`

**Beat 6 — Return to Kael**
- Player flies back to the landing pad (waypoint marker active)
- Lands (this time without the auto-assist prompt — player does it themselves)
- Kael meets them:

> **Kael:** "Thirty units, not bad for a first run. Let me show you the refinery — we'll turn this rock into something useful."

- Camera shows Kael leading player to a small refinery station next to the pad
- Refinery UI opens:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  REFINERY                               │
│                                         │

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Player taps Refine. Progress bar fills. 10 Refined Steel appears in inventory
- Kael: *"Good stuff. Now we can actually fix your ship. But first — let me teach you to build something."*

- **Quest complete** notification + reward:
```
  ✓ QUEST COMPLETE: Scrap and Survive
  Reward: Repair Kit Blueprint unlocked
  Your ship has been repaired to 75% hull integrity.
```

---

### Chapter 1.4 — Tools of the Trade (~4 min)

**Beat 1 — Crafting Introduction**
- Kael leads you to a Portable Workbench beside his workshop:

> **Kael:** "Any pilot worth their fuel knows how to build their own tools. Here — I'll share the blueprints for a proper mining drill and a basic scanner. Your mining laser works, but a drill pulls twice the yield."

- **Blueprint unlocked** notification:
  - Portable Drill blueprint
  - Basic Scanner blueprint

- Crafting UI opens:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Player crafts both. 8 Refined Steel consumed, 2 remaining

**Beat 2 — Equipment Slots**
> **Kael:** "Now let's put 'em on your ship."

- Equipment screen opens (first time):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  YOUR SHIP — XS Shuttle (T1)            │
│                                         │

│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

```
HUD hint:
  Drag equipment from inventory to a slot, or tap an empty slot to equip.
```

- Player equips the Portable Drill (replaces mining laser — higher yield) and Basic Scanner (utility slot)
- Kael: *"Now you're looking like a real miner. Take her up — scanner'll show you where the good stuff is."*

**Beat 3 — Scanner in Action**
- Player takes off. The scanner is now active on the HUD
- Nearby deposits now show type and quality indicators (before they were just visual):
```
  ◆ Ferrite Deposit — 85% purity — 120 units
  ◆ Ferrite Deposit — 62% purity — 80 units
  ◇ Tritanium Deposit — 91% purity — 40 units  [NEW RESOURCE]
```
- Kael on comms: *"See those blue markers? Tritanium. Rarer than Ferrite, worth a lot more. If you spot any, grab it."*
- Player can now explore freely for a moment — the scanner reveals the world has more depth than they realized

- **Quest complete:**
```
  ✓ QUEST COMPLETE: Tools of the Trade
  Reward: Portable Drill equipped, Basic Scanner equipped
  New quest available: First Haul
```

---

### Chapter 1.5 — First Haul (~5 min)

**Beat 1 — The Assignment**
- Kael on comms:
> *"Alright, here's how this works in the real galaxy. You mine, you haul it to the city, you sell it. Uurf Central Hub has the biggest market in Sol Proxima. Fill your cargo and fly it there — I'll send you the coordinates."*

```
  NEW QUEST: First Haul
  Fill your cargo bay (50 units) and sell at Uurf Central Hub.
```
- A new waypoint appears: Uurf Central Hub, 8km northeast

**Beat 2 — Free Mining**
- Player mines using their new drill (visibly better — faster extraction, more yield per node)
- Scanner shows deposit locations — player chooses where to fly
- This is the first moment of **real player agency** — no one is telling them which deposit to hit
- Cargo fills: `32/50... 41/50... 50/50 — CARGO FULL`
```
HUD notification:
  Cargo bay full. Head to Uurf Central Hub to sell.
```

**Beat 3 — Flight to the City**
- Player flies toward the Central Hub waypoint
- Terrain changes as they approach: more structures, roads, other ships visible in the sky
- The city comes into view — a sprawling hub with towers, docking platforms, ship traffic
- Kael: *"Home sweet home. Land at the trade terminal — the big platform with the blue lights."*

**Beat 4 — City Landing and Exploration**
- Player lands at the trade terminal dock
- Camera transitions to third-person city view (different from cockpit flight)
- The city is alive: NPC vendors, other players' ships docked, market boards, signage
```
HUD hint:
  Welcome to Uurf Central Hub. Approach the Market Terminal to sell.
```

**Beat 5 — First Sale**
- Player approaches the Market Terminal (glowing kiosk)
- Market UI opens:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  MARKET — Uurf Central Hub              │
│                                         │

│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Player sells all. Balance jumps to ~490 OMEN
- Satisfying coin/chime sound. Balance animates counting up
- Kael on comms: *"Not bad for your first haul. That Tritanium's good stuff — keep an eye out for it."*

**Beat 6 — The Market Sticks**
- After selling, the market stays open briefly showing the BUY tab:
```
HUD hint:
  The market also sells equipment, blueprints, and resources
  crafted by other players. Browse when you're ready.
```
- Player can browse but doesn't need to buy anything yet. Closes when ready

- **Quest complete:**
```
  ✓ QUEST COMPLETE: First Haul
  Reward: 500 OMEN bonus (total balance now ~990 OMEN)
  Market access permanently unlocked.
```

---

### Chapter 1.6 — The Manifest (~3 min)

**Beat 1 — Sola Approaches**
- As the player leaves the market terminal, an NPC approaches them
- Sola — a sharp-eyed woman in merchant attire, datapad in hand

> **Sola:** "Excuse me — pilot. That shuttle you flew in on. Registration code XT-7749. Where did you get that ship?"
>
> **Player options:**
> - "I don't remember." *(default/canon)*
> - "Why do you care?"
> - "It's mine. That's all that matters."

- Regardless of choice, Sola continues:

> **Sola:** "That code is on the Exodus manifest. One of the original twelve arkships carried a shuttle bay full of these — the *HNSS Meridian*. She was one of the five that never arrived."
>
> **Sola:** "Except... here you are. In one of her shuttles. Five hundred years late."
>
> **Sola:** "I've been collecting data on the lost ships for years. Take this — it was recovered from a wreck near the Northern Reaches. It's a data fragment from the Meridian's flight recorder. I think you should have it."

**Beat 2 — First Artifact**
- **Item received: Data Fragment #1**
- Inventory opens briefly, showing the Artifacts tab for the first time:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ARTIFACTS                              │
│                                         │
│  ◈ Data Fragment #1                     │
│    Origin: HNSS Meridian flight recorder│
│    Status: Partially encrypted          │
│    "...signal origin does not match     │
│     any known stellar body..."          │
│                                         │
│  Collected: 1/? fragments              │
│                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Beat 3 — Story Hook Set**
> **Sola:** "There's a faint signal coming from the Northern Reaches — same frequency as this fragment. Could be another piece. But the Reaches are outside the safe zone. Be careful out there, pilot."
>
> **Sola:** "Come find me if you learn anything. I have a stall in the merchant quarter."

- Sola walks away. She's now a permanent NPC contact in the city
- The player is left with questions: Why is their shuttle from a lost arkship? What's the signal?

- **Quest complete:**
```
  ✓ QUEST COMPLETE: The Manifest
  Reward: Data Fragment #1, Sola unlocked as contact
  New quest available: Beyond the Plains
```

---

### Chapter 1.7 — Beyond the Plains (~7 min)

**Beat 1 — Heading Out**
- The new quest directs the player to the Northern Reaches — a Mild zone
- Waypoint is set. Player re-boards their ship and takes off from the city
```
  QUEST: Beyond the Plains
  Investigate the signal in Uurf's Northern Reaches.
  ⚠ Warning: Mild Zone — hostile creatures reported.
```

**Beat 2 — Zone Transition**
- As the player flies north, the terrain changes. Verdant Plains give way to rocky, harsher landscape
- A zone transition notification appears:
```
  ━━━ Entering MILD ZONE: Northern Reaches ━━━
  Hostile creatures are present.
  Your cargo may be at risk.
```
- The map border shifts from green to yellow
- Music shifts to something more tense, ambient

**Beat 3 — First Creature Encounter**
- Scanner picks up a contact. Not a deposit — a red marker:
```
  ▲ Burrower — Hostile — Distance: 200m
```
- A Burrower erupts from the ground near a rock formation. It's a medium-sized armored creature
- Kael on comms: *"Heads up — Burrowers. Territorial. They won't chase you far, but if you're near their nest they'll come at you. Your drill won't help here — you need a weapon."*

**Beat 4 — Combat Introduction**
- The player doesn't have a weapon yet — this is intentional
- Two options:
  - **Fly past it** (the Burrower can't reach the ship at altitude)
  - **Get hit** if flying low (takes minor hull damage, teaches consequence)
- Either way, the player reaches the signal source: a small wreckage site on a ridge
- Kael: *"That wreck's got what you need. Land nearby and I'll walk you through fitting a weapon."*

**Beat 5 — Salvage and Equip**
- Player lands near the wreckage. An interaction prompt appears:
```
  [Salvage Wreckage]
```
- Player taps. Salvage UI:
```
  SALVAGE — Crash Site Debris
  Found:
  ● Light Laser Turret T1
  ● 2x Repair Kit (Basic)
  ● 15x Ferrite Ore
```
- Equipment screen opens. Player equips the Light Laser Turret in the Weapon slot (replacing the Portable Drill, which moves to cargo)
```
HUD hint:
  Weapon equipped. TAP the FIRE button (right side) to shoot.
  Your mining drill has been moved to cargo — swap at any workbench.
```

**Beat 6 — First Combat**
- Player takes off. The Burrower (or another one) is nearby
- Player engages: fire button lights up on the right side of screen
- Combat is simple — the Burrower charges, player shoots while maneuvering
- Burrower goes down in 4-5 hits. Drops: `3x Organic Compound, 1x Chitin`
- Kael: *"Nice shooting. Those organics are worth something too — the market buys everything."*
- **Satisfying kill feedback**: particle burst, loot auto-collected, XP notification

**Beat 7 — The Signal Source**
- Beyond the wreck site, the signal leads to a small cave entrance in the ridge
- Player lands. Interaction prompt:
```
  [Enter Cave — Investigate Signal]
```
- Short interior sequence (not a full dungeon — just a single chamber):
  - Walls have faint markings — not human
  - In the center: a damaged data terminal, partially buried
  - Player interacts. Screen glitches. A garbled transmission plays:
  > *"...trajectory confirmed... signal origin does not match Cradle Stars coordinates... repeat, the Shepherd Signal is not coming from any known..."* *(static, cuts out)*

- **Item received: Damaged Navigation Log**
  - This isn't a Data Fragment — it's a clue that connects to Chapter 1.6's fragment

**Beat 8 — Return and Regroup**
- Player returns to Uurf Central Hub
- Visits Sola at her market stall:

> **Sola:** "A navigation log from the Meridian? And the signal coordinates don't match the Cradle Stars? That means... the Shepherd Signal didn't come from here. It came from somewhere else. Somewhere further."
>
> **Sola:** "I've heard rumors of similar data fragments found in other systems — Vulcan Belt, Central Nexus. If we could piece them together..."
>
> **Sola:** "You've got a ship. You've got a reason. The galaxy's out there, pilot."

- **Quest complete:**
```
  ✓ QUEST COMPLETE: Beyond the Plains
  Rewards:
  ● Light Laser Turret T1 (already equipped)
  ● 1,000 OMEN
  ● Damaged Navigation Log (artifact)
  ● Combat XP — Combat Skill unlocked
```

```

- The S-class Scout is delivered by Kael: *"She's not pretty, but she'll get you further than that wreck you rode in on. I upgraded the hull, gave you proper thrusters. Try not to crash this one."*
- Player's old shuttle is retired (scrapped for parts — player gets bonus materials)

### What the Player Has Learned (Without a Single Tutorial Screen)

| Mechanic | How They Learned It |
|----------|---------------------|
| Flight controls | Emergency prompt, then flying to beacon |
| Camera/look | HUD hint during flight |
| Landing | Guided landing on Uurf with Kael's voice |
| Mining | Kael directed them to deposits, they extracted |
| Heat management | Overheating happened naturally, Kael warned them |
| Refining | Used Kael's refinery to turn ore into steel |
| Crafting | Built drill and scanner at workbench |
| Equipment slots | Equipped gear onto their ship |
| Scanner usage | Saw deposits light up after equipping scanner |
| Cargo management | Filled cargo, saw weight, flew to sell |
| City navigation | Landed at hub, walked to market |
| Market (selling) | Sold ore for OMEN |
| Market (browsing) | Saw the buy tab after selling |
| NPC dialogue | Talked to Kael and Sola |
| Artifacts | Received Data Fragment, saw artifact inventory |
| Zone transitions | Flew from Friendly to Mild, saw the warning |
| Creature encounters | Met Burrowers, learned to avoid or fight |
| Combat basics | Equipped weapon, fought creature |
| Salvaging | Looted a wreck site |
| Repair kits | Found them in salvage, saw them in inventory |
| Exploration | Found a cave, investigated a signal |
| Lore hooks | Shepherd Signal mystery, lost arkship connection |

**Total time: ~30 minutes of play. Zero tutorial popups. Zero text walls. Everything learned by doing.**

---

### Post-Act 1 Guidance

After the completion screen, the player's HUD shows:

```
  SUGGESTED:
  ▶ Continue Story — Act 2: The Wider Galaxy (Vulcan Belt)
  ▶ Daily Missions available (3 missions)
  ▶ Explore Sol Proxima freely

  CONTACTS:
  💬 Kael has repair services at Uurf Landing
  💬 Sola has a lead on the next Data Fragment
```

- **Continue Story** → Act 2 quest marker on galaxy map
- **Daily Missions** → Available immediately (mine X, sell Y, visit Z)
- **Explore Freely** → The whole Sol Proxima system is open
- **Faction pings** start arriving within the next play session:
  - A Veth scholar sends a cryptic message about star charts
  - A Korvani warrior posts a bounty board challenge

The player is never stuck. There's always a next step. But they choose the pace.

---

### Onboarding Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Show, don't tell** | Every mechanic taught through player action, not explanation text |
| **NPC mentors** | Kael teaches practical skills via voice. Sola drives the story via dialogue |
| **One thing at a time** | Each chapter introduces exactly one major system |
| **Immediate reward** | Mine → sell → see OMEN go up. The loop pays off within 15 minutes |
| **Escalating stakes** | Safe plains → mild zone → creatures → combat. Tension builds naturally |
| **Curiosity over instruction** | The story makes players WANT to learn — "why is my shuttle from a lost arkship?" |
| **Failure is gentle** | Overheat the laser? 3-second cooldown. Get hit by a Burrower? Minor hull damage. Nothing punishing |
| **Player agency early** | Chapter 1.5 is the first moment of real choice — which deposits, what route, when to sell |
