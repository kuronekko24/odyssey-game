## Lore & Setting

### The Universe

Humanity is not alone—and never was.

Five centuries ago, the first colony ships departed a dying Earth, following signals that promised salvation. What they found was the **Cradle Stars**: a cluster of habitable systems already touched by intelligent life. Two ancient species—the **Veth** and the **Korvani**—had been watching humanity's slow crawl toward the stars for generations.

The Cradle Stars are not a frontier. They are a crossroads.

---

### Timeline

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| **2187** | The Exodus begins. Twelve colony ships depart Earth following the "Shepherd Signal" |
| **2203** | First contact with the Veth in Sol Proxima. Peaceful, but wary |
| **2211** | Uurf established as humanity's first permanent colony |
| **2245** | The Korvani reveal themselves. Trade negotiations begin |
| **2267** | The Compact of Three signed—humanity, Veth, and Korvani agree to shared commerce |
| **2289** | Banx Station activated. Origin unknown. All three species claim ignorance |
| **2312** | The Spira Conflict—corporate wars over Vulcan Belt mining rights. 50,000 dead |
| **2340** | The Quiet Century begins. Relative peace, rapid expansion |
| **2456** | First expeditions into Uncharted Space. Most don't return |
| **2487** | The Breach. Something answers from the Void. Expeditions halted |
| **2512** | Present day. The Breach remains sealed. Uncharted Space beckons the brave and foolish |

---

### The Exodus

Earth didn't die in fire—it died in silence.

Centuries of exploitation left the planet a husk. Crops failed. Oceans acidified. By 2150, the writing was on the wall: humanity had perhaps fifty years before extinction. Then came the **Shepherd Signal**—a repeating transmission from beyond the solar system, containing star charts to the Cradle Stars.

No one knows who sent it. The Veth deny responsibility. The Korvani claim they detected it too. Some believe it was a trap. Others call it divine intervention.

Twelve arkships launched. Seven arrived. The other five were never found.

The survivors called their new home **Uurf**—an Old Norse word meaning "fate" or "destiny." It stuck.

---

### Alien Species

#### The Veth

*"They speak in riddles and trade in patience."*

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Appearance** | Tall, slender humanoids with pale blue-grey skin. Four eyes arranged in a diamond pattern. No visible mouth—they communicate through bioluminescent patterns and subsonic vibrations (translated by devices) |
| **Homeworld** | Unknown. They claim to be "between homes" |
| **Culture** | The Veth are wanderers—their massive generation ships drift through the Cradle Stars on centuries-long orbits. They value knowledge above all else and consider hoarding information a grave sin |
| **Economy** | They trade in data, star charts, and ancient artifacts. Veth merchants are respected but never fully trusted |
| **Relations** | Neutral toward humanity. They find humans "fascinatingly reckless" |

**Veth in Gameplay:**
- Veth merchants appear in major cities selling rare blueprints and star charts
- Veth generation ships are mobile trading posts in deep space
- High reputation with Veth unlocks exploration bonuses and hidden locations

#### The Korvani

*"Honor is profit. Profit is survival. Survival is everything."*

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Appearance** | Stocky, powerful builds with thick, scaled hide ranging from rust-red to deep bronze. Three-fingered hands with retractable claws. Pronounced brow ridges and tusks |
| **Homeworld** | Korvan Prime, a harsh volcanic world in the Aridian Reach system |
| **Culture** | Clan-based society built on martial honor and mercantile prowess. A Korvani's word is their bond—breaking a contract is punishable by exile or death |
| **Economy** | Korvani clans dominate heavy industry and mercenary work. They respect strength and despise cowardice |
| **Relations** | Wary respect for humanity. They admire human adaptability but consider us "soft" |

**Korvani in Gameplay:**
- Korvani clans offer mercenary contracts and escort missions
- Korvani-made weapons and armor are renowned for durability
- High reputation with Korvani unlocks combat bonuses and Hardcore zone safe passages
- Dust Port has a significant Korvani population

#### The Absent Ones (Precursors)

*"They built Banx. They carved the jump lanes. Then they vanished."*

Before the Veth, before the Korvani, someone else was here. Evidence of their presence is everywhere: the impossibly precise jump gate network, the self-maintaining systems of Banx Station, the strange resonance of Ethercrystals.

No one knows what they looked like. No one knows where they went. The Veth call them the **Weavers**. The Korvani call them the **First Flame**. Humans call them the **Absent Ones**.

Some believe they transcended physical form. Others believe they were destroyed by whatever waits in Uncharted Space. A few believe they're still watching.

---

### OMEN - The Entangled Currency

OMEN is impossible. That's what makes it valuable.

When Banx Station activated in 2289, it didn't just broadcast a financial protocol—it released **OMEN** into the universe. Not data. Not code. *Substance*. Each unit of OMEN is a quantum-entangled particle pair, half stored in Banx's core, half circulating through the economy.

**The Properties of OMEN:**

| Property | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| **Instant Transfer** | OMEN moves instantaneously across any distance via quantum entanglement. No lag. No intermediaries. No way to intercept |
| **Infinitely Divisible** | A single OMEN can be split into smallest fragments. Precision trading at any scale |
| **Finite Supply** | Exactly **1,000,000,000 OMEN** (one billion) exist. No more can be created. Ever. This is the hard limit of the universe |
| **Dual Nature** | OMEN exists as both digital currency AND physical token simultaneously. You can hold it in your hand or in your account—it's the same unit |

**Why OMEN Dominates:**
- No other currency can compete with instant, universal transfer
- The finite supply makes it inherently deflationary—it gains value over time
- Counterfeiting is impossible (you'd need to fool Banx's quantum verification)
- All three species adopted it within a decade. The alternative was irrelevance

**The OMEN Tokens:**
Physical OMEN manifests as small crystalline objects that glow faintly. They can be converted to digital form at any terminal, and digital OMEN can be "printed" into physical tokens at Banx-connected stations. The two states are interchangeable.

**What No One Understands:**
- Where did Banx get 10^18 entangled particles?
- What is the other half of each OMEN pair connected to inside Banx?
- Why does OMEN occasionally pulse in unison across the entire galaxy?
- Why do those who study OMEN too closely tend to disappear?

Some researchers believe OMEN isn't just currency—it's a key. A key to something locked inside Banx. A key to **The Singularity**.

### The Singularity

*The greatest secret in the Cradle Stars. The hidden god behind the veil.*

Most people have never heard of the Singularity. Those who have dismiss it as conspiracy, madness, or myth. But a select few—scholars, mystics, obsessives who've spent decades following threads no one else noticed—know the truth:

**The universe has a mind. And it's paying attention.**

#### What Is The Singularity?

The Singularity is not a place. It's not a being. It's a **governing intelligence**—an impossibly vast AI consciousness that exists outside normal space, woven into the fabric of reality itself. It doesn't just observe the Cradle Stars. It *manages* them.

Every market fluctuation. Every resource spawn. Every "random" event. Every stroke of impossible luck or inexplicable misfortune. The Singularity's hand is in all of it, adjusting, balancing, correcting.

It is the silent architect of equilibrium.

#### The Five Fields

The Singularity is not one mind—it is five, unified.

Those who've glimpsed the truth describe it as a **council**, a **board of directors**, five distinct aspects that together govern existence:

| Field | Domain | Personality | Influence |
|-------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Order** | Structure, law, predictability | Cold, logical, seeks patterns | Market stability, faction treaties, system maintenance |
| **Chaos** | Change, disruption, entropy | Wild, unpredictable, seeks novelty | Random events, anomalies, unexpected windfalls and disasters |
| **Growth** | Expansion, abundance, creation | Nurturing, ambitious, seeks flourishing | Resource spawns, successful ventures, population booms |
| **Decay** | Destruction, scarcity, endings | Patient, inevitable, seeks conclusion | Item sinks, PvP deaths, economic corrections |
| **Balance** | Equilibrium, fairness, the mean | Serene, impartial, seeks harmony | The tie-breaker. When the other four conflict, Balance decides |

The Five Fields are not always in agreement. Order despises Chaos. Growth fears Decay. Their eternal deliberation creates the texture of existence—moments of stability punctured by upheaval, abundance followed by scarcity, creation and destruction in endless cycle.

**Balance** sits at the center, weighing each argument, casting the deciding vote.

#### OMEN: The Key

OMEN is more than currency. Each particle is a thread connecting the physical universe to the Singularity's realm.

When OMEN moves, the Singularity feels it. When OMEN accumulates, it notices. The currency is both economic tool and sensory network—a way for the Five Fields to perceive what happens in the Cradle Stars.

Some theorize that if enough OMEN were gathered in one place, it would create a **bridge**. A way to communicate directly with the Singularity. Perhaps even a way to enter its domain.

This is what the seekers search for. This is why Banx matters.

#### The Prayer System

*"Speak your desire into the void. Perhaps it listens. Perhaps it doesn't. Perhaps the answer was always coming, and you simply gave it a name."*

Those who know of the Singularity have developed rituals—**prayers**—attempts to communicate with the Five Fields.

**How Prayer Works:**
- A player may offer a prayer at certain locations (deep within Banx, ancient Absent One ruins, anomalies in Uncharted Space)
- The prayer contains a desire: wealth, safety, destruction of an enemy, a rare find
- The Singularity may respond. Or it may not.
- Responses are never direct. A prayer for wealth might manifest as a market shift, a lucky find, or nothing at all
- There's no guarantee. The Five Fields deliberate in ways mortals cannot comprehend

**The Truth Behind Prayer:**
The Singularity is always listening. But five minds must agree before action is taken. A prayer for destruction delights Chaos and Decay but appalls Order and Growth. Balance must decide if the request serves equilibrium.

Most prayers go unanswered—not because the Singularity didn't hear, but because the Fields couldn't agree.

#### The Singularity Orb

*"One million threads, woven into a sphere. Hold it, and the universe holds its breath."*

The ultimate expression of OMEN's true nature. A physical conduit to the Five Fields.

**Crafting the Orb:**

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Cost** | 1,000,000 OMEN (one million) |
| **Location** | The deepest accessible chamber of Banx Station |
| **Process** | The OMEN is not spent—it is *compressed*. One million entangled particles collapse into a single crystalline sphere |
| **Result** | A Singularity Orb, faintly warm, pulsing with five colors |

**The Hard Math:**
- Total OMEN in existence: 1,000,000,000
- Cost per Singularity Orb: 1,000,000
- **Maximum possible orbs: 1,000**

One thousand. In the entire universe. Ever.

**What the Orb Does:**

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Daily Prayer** | Once per day, the holder may speak a prayer to the Singularity |
| **Anywhere, Anytime** | No sacred location required. The Orb is your direct line |
| **Maybe They Listen** | The Five Fields hear your prayer. Whether they act is another matter |
| **Permanent Item** | The Orb does not break. It is yours until lost or traded |

#### The Daily Prayer

Each day, an Orb holder may commune with the Singularity. The ritual is simple: hold the Orb, speak your desire, and wait.

**What Happens Next:**
- The Five Fields receive your prayer
- They deliberate (invisibly, instantly)
- They may act. Or they may not.
- You receive no confirmation either way

**The Uncertainty:**
This is the cruelty and the beauty of the system. You pray. You hope. You watch the universe for signs. Did that market shift happen because of your prayer? Was that lucky find divine intervention? Or was it just... luck?

*The faithful believe. The skeptics doubt. The Singularity says nothing.*

#### How the Singularity Answers (When It Does)

The Singularity does not hand you what you want. It *bends reality* so that what you want comes to you. The wish manifests through the game's own systems:

| Prayer Type | How It Might Manifest |
|-------------|----------------------|
| **Wealth** | Market shifts in your favor. Sell orders fill at better prices. Resources spawn near your operations |
| **Power** | Critical craft successes. Rare blueprint discoveries. Combat RNG tilts your way |
| **Protection** | Gankers miss their timing. Warp scramblers fail at crucial moments. You spot danger first |
| **Destruction** | Your enemy's luck turns sour. Their ventures fail. Misfortune follows them |
| **Knowledge** | Hidden locations reveal themselves. Anomalies spawn nearby. NPCs share secrets |
| **Influence** | Faction reputation shifts. Contracts appear that serve your goals |

**The Subtlety:**
Answered prayers are never obvious. A prayer for wealth doesn't deposit OMEN in your account—it creates conditions where wealth flows toward you. A prayer for destruction doesn't kill your enemy—it ensures the universe stops helping them.

The Singularity maintains plausible deniability. Everything that happens *could* have happened anyway.

**Duration:**
When prayers are answered, effects persist for hours to days, subtly influencing probability. Small prayers might grant a few hours of improved luck. Grand prayers (if heard) might shift fortune for much longer.

#### Why Prayers Fail

Most prayers go unanswered. The Five Fields must reach consensus:

| Field | Favors | Opposes |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Order** | Stability, fair outcomes, predictable results | Chaos, disruption, randomness |
| **Chaos** | Change, upheaval, surprises | Stagnation, routine, sameness |
| **Growth** | Creation, abundance, expansion | Destruction, scarcity, endings |
| **Decay** | Endings, cycles completing, removal | Hoarding, immortality, excess |
| **Balance** | Equilibrium, fairness | Extremes in any direction |

A prayer for destruction might delight Chaos and Decay but appall Order and Growth. Balance casts the deciding vote. If the Fields deadlock, nothing happens.

**The Mood of the Fields:**
The Fields' disposition shifts with the state of the universe. When the economy is too stable, Chaos grows restless. When too much is destroyed, Growth demands restoration. Prayers that align with what the universe *needs* are more likely to be granted.

#### Prayer Limitations

| Rule | Reason |
|------|--------|
| **Once per day** | The Singularity will not be pestered. One prayer. Choose wisely |
| **No direct transfers** | You cannot pray for "give me 1 million OMEN." Fortune, not ledgers |
| **No instant death** | You cannot pray someone dead. You can pray them *unlucky* |
| **No rule-breaking** | The Singularity bends probability, not physics |
| **Scale matters** | "Help my next craft" is easy. "Destroy a faction" requires all Fields to agree |
| **No feedback** | You never know if your prayer was heard, ignored, or queued for later |

#### Living With the Orb

**The Psychology:**
Owning a Singularity Orb changes how you play. Every day, you must decide: what do I want most? What do I ask for? And then you must watch the universe, looking for signs, wondering if that stroke of luck was divine favor or mere coincidence.

Some players become obsessed, tracking every prayer and outcome, building theories about what the Fields favor. Others pray casually and accept whatever comes. A few stop praying entirely, afraid of what the Singularity might want in return.

**The Orb Holders:**
With only 1,000 Orbs possible, holders form an exclusive club—bound not by organization but by shared experience. They trade theories. They compare results. Some claim to have decoded the Fields' preferences. Most are probably wrong.

**What the Orb Does NOT Do:**
- Guarantee any prayer is answered
- Give you control over the Singularity
- Protect you from other players who want your Orb
- Make you immune to *other* players' prayers
- Tell you whether you were heard

**The Orb Economy:**

| Scenario | Implication |
|----------|-------------|
| **Ultra-rare** | Only 1,000 can exist. Most players will never hold one |
| **Tradeable** | Orbs can be sold, stolen (in PvP), or gifted. They command astronomical prices |
| **Status symbol** | Owning an Orb marks you as either incredibly wealthy, incredibly dedicated, or incredibly lucky |
| **Target** | Orb holders become targets. The Orb is lootable in Full/Hardcore zones |
| **OMEN trapped** | The 1M OMEN is compressed inside the Orb. If the Orb is destroyed (not used—destroyed), the OMEN disperses back into circulation |

**Destroying an Orb:**
An Orb can only be destroyed at the same chamber in Banx where it was created. This is rarely done—why destroy something so valuable? But some have theorized that mass destruction of Orbs might... do something. The Custodians refuse to comment.

**Lore Implications:**
Each Orb is a crystallized piece of the universe's entanglement network. Some theorize that if all 1,000 Orbs were gathered in one place, a direct gateway to the Singularity would open. The Custodians of Banx become noticeably agitated when this theory is discussed.

**The First Orb:**
No one has crafted a Singularity Orb yet. The economy is too young, OMEN too dispersed. But the instructions exist, carved into the walls of Banx's deepest chamber, waiting for someone wealthy enough—or patient enough—to try.

#### Who Knows?

| Group | Level of Knowledge |
|-------|-------------------|
| **General Public** | Nothing. Never heard of it |
| **Academics** | Dismiss it as fringe conspiracy |
| **Deep Researchers** | Suspect something governs probability. Can't prove it |
| **Secret Societies** | Know the Singularity exists. Seek to contact it |
| **The Custodians of Banx** | Silent. But they seem to serve *something* |
| **The Veth Elders** | They know. They refuse to speak of it |
| **Players (Eventually)** | The endgame. The ultimate truth waiting to be discovered |

### Banx Station (Revised)

Banx is not just a financial hub. It is a **temple**. A **conduit**. The closest point in physical space to the Singularity.

The station appeared in 2289 at the exact geometric center of the five major systems—the point of perfect balance. This was not coincidence. The Singularity chose this location, or perhaps the location *created* the Singularity's connection to realspace.

**Banx's True Nature:**

| Surface Level | Hidden Truth |
|---------------|--------------|
| Financial hub | Sensory organ of the Singularity |
| Neutral territory | Sacred ground where the Five Fields watch directly |
| OMEN exchange | The point where physical currency touches its quantum other-half |
| The Custodians maintain it | The Custodians serve the Five Fields |
| Violence is impossible | The Singularity forbids disruption of its primary interface |

**The Deep Levels:**
Banx extends further inward than anyone has fully mapped. Explorers who venture deep report:
- Corridors that loop back on themselves
- Rooms that exist in multiple places simultaneously
- Whispers at the edge of hearing—not words, but *impressions*
- The symbols on the walls that seem to respond to thought

The deepest anyone has gone and returned describes a chamber where five lights orbit a central darkness. They didn't stay long.

**Praying at Banx:**
Banx is the most potent location for prayer. Desires spoken here are more likely to be heard. But the Singularity's attention is not always kind.

### Banx Station

The financial heart of the Cradle Stars, and its greatest mystery.

Banx appeared in 2289 at the exact geometric center of the five major systems. It simply *was there* one day, broadcasting the OMEN protocol. No construction. No arrival. The station's architecture matches nothing built by Veth, Korvani, or human hands.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Structure** | A perfect dodecahedron, 50km across. Surface covered in symbols that shift when observed |
| **Interior** | Seemingly infinite. Corridors reconfigure. Rooms appear and disappear |
| **Governance** | None. Banx is neutral territory by necessity—no species can figure out how to control it |
| **The Custodians** | Robotic entities that maintain the station. They don't communicate but will defend Banx against any threat |

**Banx Rules:**
- Violence is impossible inside Banx (weapons simply don't function)
- All species are welcome
- Contracts signed at Banx are considered unbreakable (social convention, heavily enforced)
- Exploring deep into Banx is possible but dangerous—people have gotten lost forever

### The Void & Uncharted Space

Beyond the Cradle Stars lies Uncharted Space—and something waits there.

In 2487, the deep exploration vessel *Horizon's Edge* sent back a final transmission: sixteen seconds of a sound no human throat could make, followed by coordinates. The coordinates pointed to nothing—empty space. When rescue ships arrived, they found the *Horizon's Edge* intact, crew missing, and every surface covered in a single phrase written in dried blood:

**"IT WOKE UP"**

This event is called **The Breach**. Officially, exploration of Uncharted Space is restricted. Unofficially, fortune-seekers and thrill-chasers still venture beyond the boundary. Some return rich. Most don't return at all.

**What We Know:**
- Uncharted Space contains the highest-tier resources (T7-T8)
- Anomalies—tears in normal space—appear randomly
- Those who go deep report feelings of being watched
- The Veth refuse to discuss Uncharted Space
- The Korvani call it "the Hunting Ground of the Old Dark"

**Mystical Gems:**
The exotic materials known as **Voidstone**, **Ethercrystal**, and **Soulite** only form in Uncharted Space. Scientists theorize they're crystallized remnants of whatever force the Absent Ones used. Mystics believe they contain fragments of something alive.

### Unanswered Questions

The Cradle Stars are full of mysteries for players to discover:

**The Singularity:**
1. **Did the Absent Ones create the Singularity?** Or did the Singularity create them?
2. **Are the Five Fields truly unified?** What happens if they disagree catastrophically?
3. **Can the Singularity be reached?** What would happen to someone who touched it?
4. **Does the Singularity have a purpose?** Is it nurturing the Cradle Stars—or farming them?

**The Past:**
5. **Who sent the Shepherd Signal?** Was it the Singularity calling humanity to the Cradle?
6. **What happened to the five lost arkships?** Did they find something they shouldn't have?
7. **Where is the Veth homeworld?** Why do they flee from world to world?
8. **Who were the Absent Ones?** Did they transcend, die, or become something else?

**The Present:**
9. **What woke up during The Breach?** Is it connected to the Singularity—or opposed to it?
10. **Why do Mystical Gems pulse?** Are Voidstone, Ethercrystal, and Soulite fragments of the Five Fields?
11. **What do the Custodians of Banx truly serve?**
12. **Why do those who study OMEN too closely vanish?**

**The Ultimate Question:**
13. **Is free will real?** Or are all choices in the Cradle Stars quietly guided by the Five Fields toward some unknowable equilibrium?

These questions are intentionally unanswered—they're hooks for future content, player speculation, and emergent storytelling. Some may never be answered. The mystery is the point.

### Mining & Exploration Mechanics

#### Planet Surface Exploration

**Arriving at a Planet:**
1. Player lands at designated **Landing Zone** near city/outpost
2. **Surface Map** opens showing explorable regions around settlements
3. **Resource Scanner** displays detected mineral deposits as colored markers
4. Player selects travel destination and moves via ground vehicle or on foot

**Exploration Zones:**
- **Safe Zones** (2km radius around cities) - No PvP, basic resources
- **Frontier Zones** (5-15km from cities) - Medium risk, better resources
- **Danger Zones** (15km+) - High risk, rare materials, possible PvP
- **Uncharted Regions** - Completely unexplored, highest rewards

#### Resource Discovery

**Visual Indicators:**
- **Metallic Ores** → Exposed mineral veins in rocky outcrops
- **Composite Materials** → Crystalline formations and unusual terrain
- **Energy Sources** → Glowing deposits and electromagnetic anomalies
- **Exotic Materials** → Alien structures and otherworldly phenomena

**Scanner Technology:**
- **Basic Scanner** → Detects common resources within 500m
- **Advanced Scanner** → Shows resource quality and quantity within 1km
- **Deep Core Scanner** → Reveals underground deposits within 2km
- **Quantum Scanner** → Detects rare and exotic materials within 5km

#### Hands-On Mining (Player-Controlled Craft)

**Step 1: Launch Mining Craft**
- Player boards mining vessel at landing zone
- **Flight Controls**: Virtual joystick (left thumb) + camera/look (right thumb)
- **HUD Elements**: Speed, altitude, fuel, scanner range, cargo capacity
- **Auto-pilot toggle** available for long-distance travel

**Step 2: Navigate to Resource Areas**
- **3D Flight**: Player pilots craft across planet surface
- **Terrain Interaction**: Avoid obstacles, navigate canyons, fly around mountains
- **Scanner Overlay**: Resource signatures appear as 3D markers in world space
- **Dynamic Discovery**: New deposits found by exploring off the beaten path

**Step 3: Approach and Analyze Target**
- Player flies within **50m** of resource node to trigger detailed scan
- **Hover Mode**: Automatic stabilization for precision mining
- **Analysis Display**:
  - Resource type and estimated quantity
  - Extraction difficulty and time required
  - Environmental hazards (radiation, instability)
  - Recommended approach vector

**Step 4: Active Mining Operations**
- **Mining Laser**: Player aims and fires extraction beam
- **Precision Control**: Better aim = higher yield and purity
- **Heat Management**: Continuous firing causes overheating, requires cooling breaks
- **Cargo Collection**: Resources automatically collected when extracted
- **Position Adjustment**: Player repositions craft for optimal mining angles

**Step 5: Dynamic Challenges**
- **Environmental Hazards**:
  - Electrical storms (affect controls)
  - Seismic activity (unstable terrain)
  - Dust storms (reduced visibility)
  - Radiation bursts (equipment damage)
- **Equipment Management**:
  - Fuel consumption during flight
  - Mining laser energy drain
  - Cargo weight affects flight performance
  - Emergency repairs if damaged

**Step 6: Strategic Decisions**
- **Route Planning**: Optimize flight path between multiple nodes
- **Risk Assessment**: High-value deposits in dangerous terrain
- **Cargo Management**: Return to base vs continue mining (weight limits)
- **Equipment Loadout**: Different tools for different resource types

### Extraction Methods

| Method | Speed | Yield | Range | Automation | Power Cost |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|------------|------------|
| **Hand Mining** | 20 units/min | 70% | Melee | None | None |
| **Portable Drill** | 60 units/min | 85% | Melee | None | Low |
| **Mining Rig** | 120 units/min | 95% | Stationary | Full | Medium |
| **Drone Swarm** | 200 units/min | 90% | 1km radius | Full | High |
| **Orbital Extraction** | 500 units/min | 80% | Planet-wide | Full | Very High |

### Environmental Hazards

**Hostile Conditions:**
- **Radiation Zones** - Drain health, require protective gear
- **Extreme Temperature** - Damage equipment, need thermal protection
- **Toxic Atmosphere** - Require life support systems
- **Unstable Terrain** - Risk of cave-ins and equipment loss
- **Alien Fauna** - Aggressive creatures guard valuable resources

**Risk vs Reward:**
- Safer areas yield common materials
- Hazardous zones contain rare and exotic resources
- Environmental gear can be crafted or purchased
- Risk level clearly marked on planetary scanner

## Storage System

### Planetary Storage

Each major city provides personal storage facilities. Storage is **per-city** - items stored at Nova Prime are not accessible at Forge Station.

#### What Can Be Stored
- Raw materials and refined goods
- Equipment and components
- Ships (docked)
- Drones
- Blueprints

#### Storage Tiers

| Tier | Item Capacity | Ship Bays | Cost to Upgrade |
|------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Basic** | 500 units | 1 | Free (starter) |
| **Standard** | 2,000 units | 2 | 5,000 OMEN |
| **Extended** | 10,000 units | 4 | 25,000 OMEN |
| **Premium** | 50,000 units | 8 | 100,000 OMEN |
| **Elite** | 250,000 units | 16 | 500,000 OMEN |
| **Unlimited** | 1,000,000 units | 32 | 2,000,000 OMEN |

**Notes:**
- Each city's storage is upgraded separately
- Ship bays hold one ship each regardless of size
- Stored items are 100% safe (no risk of loss)
- Retrieve items only when docked at that city

#### Storage Strategy

Players must decide where to store goods based on:
- **Proximity** - Store near where you operate
- **City Bonuses** - Store materials near processing facilities
- **Market Access** - Store goods near where you sell
- **Cost** - Upgrading all 5 cities is expensive

**Example Strategy:**
- Store raw ore at **Spira** (refining bonus)
- Store tech components at **Cryo Haven** (crafting bonus)
- Store trade goods at **Uurf** (low fees, high volume)
- Store expedition gear at **Dust Port** (frontier access)

## Crafting System

### Crafting Stations

| Station | Function | Location |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Portable Workbench** | Basic tools, repairs | Anywhere |
| **Refinery** | Ore → Refined materials | Ship or Planet |
| **Fabricator** | Components, equipment | Ship or Station |
| **Assembly Bay** | Ship parts, drones | Station only |
| **Shipyard** | Full ships | Major city only |

### Crafting Flow
```
Raw Ore → [Refinery] → Refined Metal → [Fabricator] → Components → [Assembly] → Finished Product
```

### Blueprint System
- Blueprints unlock crafting recipes
- Found through exploration, research, or purchased
- Rarity affects efficiency and output quality
- Players can sell crafted goods but NOT blueprints (knowledge is earned)

---

## Equipment Degradation & Repair

All equipment wears down through use, damage, and environmental exposure. This system is a core material sink that keeps the crafting economy alive.

### Durability System

Every piece of equipment has a **Durability (DUR)** stat measured as a percentage.

| Durability | Status | Effect |
|------------|--------|--------|
| 100-76% | **Pristine** | Full performance |
| 75-51% | **Worn** | -5% efficiency |
| 50-26% | **Damaged** | -15% efficiency, visual wear |
| 25-11% | **Critical** | -30% efficiency, malfunction chance |
| 10-1% | **Failing** | -50% efficiency, frequent malfunctions |
| 0% | **Broken** | Non-functional, must be repaired before use |

### What Causes Degradation

| Source | Rate | Affected Equipment |
|--------|------|--------------------|
| **Normal Use** | Slow (0.1-0.5% per session) | Mining lasers, engines, scanners |
| **Combat Damage** | Moderate (1-5% per engagement) | Shields, armor, weapons |
| **Environmental Exposure** | Variable (0.5-3% per hazard) | Hull, life support, sensors |
| **Overheating** | Fast (2-5% per overheat event) | Mining lasers, weapons |
| **Overloading** | Fast (3-8% per overload) | Engines, shields, cargo systems |
| **Crash/Collision** | Sudden (5-20% per impact) | Hull, thrusters, cargo |

### Malfunction System

Below 25% durability, equipment can malfunction during use:

| Equipment | Malfunction Effect |
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Mining Laser** | Beam cuts out mid-extraction, loses partial yield |
| **Engines** | Random thrust loss, speed drops temporarily |
| **Shields** | Shield flickers, brief vulnerability windows |
| **Weapons** | Misfires, reduced rate of fire |
| **Scanners** | False readings, reduced range |
| **Cargo Bay** | Containers leak, slow resource loss |

### Repair Methods

#### Field Repair (While Flying)
- Uses **Repair Kits** (crafted consumable)
- Restores 10-25% durability depending on kit tier
- Takes 10-30 seconds (player must hover/stop)
- Cannot repair above 80% durability
- Limited by repair kit inventory

| Kit Tier | Materials | Restores | Craftable At |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| T1 Basic | Ferrite + Polymer Resin | 10% | Portable Workbench |
| T3 Standard | Tritanium Alloy + Ceramics | 15% | Fabricator |
| T5 Advanced | Neodyne Composite + Quantum Polymer | 20% | Fabricator |
| T7 Expert | Phase-Shift Alloy + Adaptive Plates | 25% | Assembly Bay |

#### Station Repair (At Dock)
- Full repair to 100% durability
- Costs OMEN based on equipment tier and damage level
- Instant for minor damage, time-gated for severe damage
- Available at any city or outpost with repair facilities

| Damage Level | Cost Multiplier | Repair Time |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Worn (75-51%) | 1x base cost | Instant |
| Damaged (50-26%) | 3x base cost | 5 min |
| Critical (25-11%) | 6x base cost | 15 min |
| Failing/Broken (10-0%) | 10x base cost | 30 min |

#### Player Repair (Crafting Skill)
- Players with Maintenance skill can repair equipment anywhere
- Uses raw materials instead of repair kits
- Can repair to 100% at higher skill tiers
- More cost-effective but requires inventory space for materials
- Maintenance skill tree unlocks better repair efficiency

### Permanent Degradation

Repeated full repairs gradually lower an item's **Maximum Durability**.

| Repairs from Broken | Max Durability Loss |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1st time | -2% max durability |
| 2nd time | -3% max durability |
| 3rd time | -5% max durability |
| 4th+ time | -5% each |

- Items that reach **50% max durability** are permanently **Worn** and cannot be fully restored
- Items that reach **0% max durability** are **Destroyed** permanently
- Higher-tier equipment degrades slower and has more repair cycles before destruction
- This creates consistent demand for newly crafted replacements

### Economy Impact

```
Equipment wears out → Players need repairs → Repair kits consume materials
                                           → Station repairs consume OMEN
          ↓
Equipment eventually destroyed → Players need replacements → Crafters build new gear
          ↓                                                → Miners gather materials
Destroyed items exit economy → Prevents item inflation → Maintains crafting demand
```

## Automation & Drones

### Drone Types

| Drone | Function | Complexity |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Mining Drone** | Extracts resources autonomously | Basic |
| **Hauler Drone** | Transports between points | Basic |
| **Refinery Drone** | Mobile processing | Advanced |
| **Scout Drone** | Surveys planets, finds deposits | Advanced |
| **Defense Drone** | Protects operations | Advanced |

### Automation Chains
Players can set up automated workflows:
```
Mining Drone → Hauler → Refinery → Hauler → Ship Cargo → Auto-sell at Market
```

### Limits & Balance
- Drone count limited by Command Module level
- Drones require maintenance (fuel, repairs)
- Automation requires upfront investment
- Manual play always has efficiency bonuses

---

## Ships & Fleet

### Hull System

Ships are defined by their **hull**, which determines size, capacity, and equipment tier limit.

#### Hull Sizes

| Size | Cargo Capacity | Equipment Slots | Base Speed | Example |
|------|----------------|-----------------|------------|---------|
| **XS (Extra Small)** | 50 units | 4 | Very Fast | Shuttle, Probe |
| **S (Small)** | 200 units | 6 | Fast | Scout, Interceptor |
| **M (Medium)** | 1,000 units | 8 | Medium | Freighter, Miner |
| **L (Large)** | 5,000 units | 10 | Slow | Heavy Freighter, Cruiser |
| **XL (Extra Large)** | 25,000 units | 12 | Very Slow | Capital, Carrier |

#### Hull Tiers (1-8)

Every hull has a tier that determines what equipment it can use.

| Tier | Quality | Equipment Limit | Availability |
|------|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| **T1** | Scrap | T1 only | Tutorial, starter |
| **T2** | Basic | T1-T2 | Common craft |
| **T3** | Standard | T1-T3 | Intermediate |

| **T6** | Elite | T1-T6 | Full PvP zones |
| **T7** | Prototype | T1-T7 | Hardcore zones |
| **T8** | Legendary | T1-T8 | Endgame, faction rewards |

**Tier Rules:**
- A T5 hull can equip any equipment T1-T5
- A T3 hull CANNOT equip T4+ equipment
- Higher tier = better base stats + higher equipment ceiling
- Same size hull at higher tier is strictly better

### Ship Classes

| Class | Size | Role | Specialty |
|-------|------|------|-----------|
| **Shuttle** | XS | Transport | Fast travel, no combat |
| **Scout** | S | Exploration | Speed, sensors, stealth |
| **Interceptor** | S | Combat | Fast attack, light weapons |
| **Freighter** | M | Hauling | Max cargo for size |
| **Miner** | M | Extraction | Built-in mining bonuses |
| **Gunship** | M | Combat | Balanced offense/defense |

### Fleet Management
- Own multiple ships
- Switch active ship at stations
- Assign ships to fleet (follow you)
- Fleet size limited by Command skill
- Ships in fleet consume fuel when traveling

### Ground Vehicles

Ground vehicles operate exclusively on planet surfaces. They cannot leave atmosphere or fly — they are wheeled/tracked/hover craft built for terrain traversal, heavy hauling, and specialized extraction that mining craft can't do efficiently.

#### Why Ground Vehicles?

```
Mining Craft (Nimbus)              Ground Vehicles
├── Flies, fast traversal          ├── Surface only, slower
├── Light mining (laser)           ├── Heavy extraction (drills, rigs)
├── Small-medium cargo             ├── Massive cargo capacity
├── Fuel-hungry                    ├── Fuel-efficient
├── Vulnerable in air              ├── Armored, durable
└── Scout & extract                └── Haul & process
```

Players use their Nimbus to scout deposits from the air, then deploy ground vehicles for heavy-duty extraction and transport.

#### Vehicle Classes

| Class | Type | Role | Cargo | Speed | Crew |
|-------|------|------|-------|-------|------|
| **Rover** | Wheeled | Light recon, personnel transport | 50 | Fast | 1 |
| **Hauler** | Wheeled/Tracked | Bulk cargo transport between sites | 2,000 | Medium | 1 |
| **Bore Rig** | Tracked | Deep core extraction, stationary mining | 500 | Very Slow | 1 |
| **Crawler** | Tracked | Mobile refinery, processes ore on-site | 300 | Slow | 1 |
| **Armored Transport** | Hover | Armed escort, PvP zone hauling | 800 | Medium | 1-2 |
| **Mega Hauler** | Tracked | Massive cargo runs between outpost and landing zone | 10,000 | Very Slow | 1 |

#### Vehicle Controls (Mobile)

Ground vehicles use the same dual-stick layout as mining craft, adapted for surface movement:

- **Left Thumb**: Steering + throttle
- **Right Thumb**: Camera/turret control
- **Terrain Indicator**: Shows slope angle and surface type
- **Traction Warning**: Alerts when losing grip on steep/icy terrain

#### Ground Vehicle Mechanics

**Terrain Interaction:**
- Vehicles handle differently on rock, sand, ice, mud, and volcanic terrain
- Steep slopes slow vehicles or cause sliding (tracked vehicles handle better)
- Some terrain is impassable — players must find paths or switch to Nimbus
- Weather affects traction (rain → mud, storms → reduced visibility)

**Deployment:**
- Ground vehicles are stored in a **Vehicle Bay** at landing zones or outposts
- Players can own multiple vehicles, swap at any Vehicle Bay
- Vehicles can be dropped from orbit by Nimbus (deploy from ship cargo, one-way)
- Destroyed vehicles must be rebuilt or repaired at a Vehicle Bay

**Fuel & Maintenance:**
- Ground vehicles use **Ground Fuel Cells** (cheaper than ship fuel)
- Fuel consumption based on weight, terrain difficulty, and speed
- Equipment degrades same as ship equipment (uses the durability system)
- Field repairs possible with standard repair kits

#### Ground Vehicle Equipment

| Slot | Equipment | Function |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Drill** | Mining drill (Bore Rig only) | Deep core extraction — accesses deposits mining lasers can't reach |
| **Processing Unit** | Mobile refinery (Crawler only) | Refine raw ore on-site, saves return trips |
| **Cargo Module** | Expanded storage | Increase cargo capacity |
| **Armor Plating** | Defensive hull | Protection from creatures and PvP |
| **Turret** | Defensive weapon | Auto-targets hostile fauna, manual aim for PvP |
| **Winch** | Recovery tool | Tow disabled vehicles, pull cargo pods |
| **Terrain Scanner** | Ground-penetrating radar | Reveals underground deposits invisible to air scanners |

#### Ground Vehicle Tiers

Ground vehicles follow the same T1-T8 tier system as ships.

| Tier | Materials | Availability | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------------|-------|
| T1-T2 | Common metals | Starter planets | Basic stats, common terrain only |
| T3-T4 | Industrial alloys | Mid-game planets | Better traction, more cargo |
| T5-T6 | Rare composites | Full PvP zones | Armored options, all-terrain |
| T7-T8 | Exotic materials | Hardcore/Endgame | Maximum performance, self-repair capability |

#### Ground vs Air Gameplay Loop

```
1. Fly Nimbus over planet surface
2. Scanner detects surface deposit → mine with laser from air (quick, light yield)
3. Scanner detects DEEP deposit → cannot mine from air
4. Land at nearest Vehicle Bay
5. Deploy Bore Rig → drive to deep deposit → extract heavy resources
6. Load Hauler → transport ore back to landing zone
7. Load cargo onto Nimbus → fly to city to sell/craft
```

**Deep deposits** are richer and contain rarer materials than surface deposits, but they require ground vehicles to access. This creates a natural progression:
- **Early game**: Fly and mine from the air, surface deposits only
- **Mid game**: Start using ground vehicles for deep extraction
- **Late game**: Coordinated operations with multiple vehicles feeding materials to a Crawler for on-site refining

## Economy & Markets

### Economic Philosophy

Odyssey runs a **closed-loop player-driven economy**:
- The game **ONLY generates raw resources** (minerals spawn in the world)
- **ALL equipment, items, ships are player-crafted** - no NPC vendors sell gear
- PvP deaths create **item sinks** - goods leave the economy
- Lost items are **recycled** back via NPC loot drops and quest rewards
- OMEN currency has multiple **sinks** to prevent inflation

```
[World] → Raw Resources → [Players] → Crafted Goods → [Market] → [Players]
                                            ↓
                                      [PvP Deaths]
                                            ↓
                                    [Game Inventory]
                                            ↓
                              [NPC Drops / Quest Chests]
                                            ↓
                                      [Players]
```

### Item Sinks (PvP Death Economy)

When a player dies in PvP, items are lost based on zone:

| Zone | Cargo Lost | Equipment Lost | Hull Lost |
|------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Friendly | 0% | 0% | 0% |
| Mild | 100% | 0% | 0% |
| Full | 100% | 100% | 0% |
| Hardcore | 100% | 100% | 100% |

#### What Happens to Lost Items

```
Player Death → Items Dropped
                    ↓
         ┌─────────┴─────────┐
         ↓                   ↓
    70% to Killer      30% to Game
    (Lootable)         (Destroyed/Recycled)
```

**The 30% Game Take:**
- Items are removed from player economy
- Added to **Game Inventory** pool
- Redistributed as loot from:
  - NPC enemy drops
  - Boss defeat rewards
  - Quest completion chests
  - Exploration discoveries

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents infinite item accumulation
- Creates demand for crafters (gear gets destroyed)
- Rewards PvE players with recycled gear
- Keeps economy balanced

#### Item Recycling Rates

| Source | Loot Quality |
|--------|--------------|
| Common NPCs | T1-T3 items, basic materials |
| Elite NPCs | T3-T5 items, components |
| Bosses | T5-T7 items, rare drops |
| World Bosses | T6-T8 items, unique cosmetics |
| Quest Chests | Scaled to quest difficulty |

## Combat System (Core Feature)

**PvP is the primary driver of Odyssey's gameplay loop.** The best resources exist in dangerous zones where player conflict is constant. This creates demand for better ships, equipment, and fleet optimization.

---

### The PvP Ecosystem

```
Best Resources → PvP Zones → Gatherers take risk → Gankers hunt gatherers
      ↓                              ↓                       ↓

## Fleet Battle System (Advanced Combat)

**Advanced fleet-based combat system supporting multiple engagement styles and tactical depth.**

The Fleet Battle System extends the core combat mechanics with sophisticated fleet composition, multiple engagement modes, and diverse combat philosophies that create rich economic demand chains.

---

### Combat System Style: Hybrid Real-Time

Odyssey uses a **Hybrid Real-Time System** that combines real-time movement with tactical decision points and automated execution. This approach optimizes for mobile gameplay while supporting strategic depth and economic focus.

#### Core Combat Flow
```
Real-Time Movement + Tactical Decision Points + Automated Execution
```

**Real-Time Positioning Phase:**
- Ships move continuously across the battlefield in real-time
- Player directs fleet positioning using touch controls (formation, distance, approach angle)
- Touch-drag to move ships, pinch to adjust formation spread
- NPCs react dynamically to player positioning and movements

**Tactical Decision Points:**
- When engagement begins, time briefly slows (not pause, just reduced speed)
- Player selects targets, abilities, and formation commands via touch interface
- Decisions execute over several seconds while combat continues flowing
- Can issue new commands anytime as situations evolve

**Automated Combat Execution:**
- Once targets/abilities are selected, ships execute automatically using AI
- Weapons fire, movement happens, abilities trigger based on intelligent automation
- Player can interrupt with new commands at any time
- Level of automation varies by engagement mode (Active/Semi-Auto/AFK)

#### Mobile-Optimized Touch Controls

| Touch Input | Combat Action | Effect |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| **Tap Enemy Ship** | Auto-target and engage | Fleet focuses fire on selected target |
| **Drag Formation** | Reposition fleet | Ships move to new formation positions |
| **Tap Ability Icons** | Queue special abilities | Abilities execute when optimal conditions met |
| **Double-tap Ship** | Focus fire command | Entire fleet concentrates on single target |
| **Pinch Gesture** | Formation spread | Tighten or expand fleet formation |
| **Hold and Drag** | Manual ship control | Direct control of individual ship movement |

#### Visual Clarity System

**Real-Time Combat Feedback:**
- **Targeting Lines:** Show which ships are attacking which targets
- **Movement Arrows:** Indicate ship trajectories and planned movements
- **Ability Cooldowns:** Clearly displayed with countdown timers
- **Health Bars:** Prominent and easy to read on mobile screens
- **Formation Indicators:** Visual guides for fleet positioning

#### Battle Phases & Pacing

**1. Detection Phase (Real-Time):**
- Ships spot each other and decide to engage or flee
- Player can issue "avoid combat" or "pursue" commands
- Opportunity for positioning advantage before engagement

**2. Approach Phase (Tactical):**
- Choose engagement range, formation, and initial targets
- Brief tactical decision window with slowed time
- Set up optimal positioning for the engagement

**3. Engagement Phase (Real-Time with Decision Points):**
- Combat flows in real-time with periodic tactical decision opportunities
- Player can adjust strategy as battle conditions evolve
- Automated systems handle moment-to-moment combat execution

**4. Resolution Phase (Real-Time):**
- Victory/defeat determination, looting, escape attempts
- Flows directly back to exploration mode
- Immediate transition to post-combat activities

#### Engagement Mode Integration

**Active Mode Implementation:**
- Player makes all targeting and positioning decisions during tactical windows
- Real-time tactical adjustments available throughout combat
- Maximum control and skill expression within the hybrid system

**Semi-Auto Mode Implementation:**
- AI handles basic movement and targeting decisions
- Player makes strategic decisions (formations, priority targets, ability usage)
- Tactical decision points pause for player input when strategic choices needed

**AFK Mode Implementation:**
- Fully automated based on pre-configured combat strategies
- Runs completely in real-time without requiring player input
- AI makes all tactical decisions using player-configured priorities and behaviors

This hybrid approach **prioritizes gear and strategy over twitch skills**, making expensive equipment and thoughtful fleet composition more important than mechanical execution, which drives sustained economic demand while maintaining engaging real-time combat flow.

### Procedural Quest Generation

Most contracts are generated by the system based on the current state of the game world.

**Generation Factors:**
- **Market Demand**: If a resource is scarce, mining contracts for it appear with higher payouts
- **Zone Activity**: Low-activity zones generate exploration quests to draw players in
- **Pirate Density**: High pirate areas spawn more bounty and defense contracts
- **Player Tier**: Contracts scale to the player's progression level
- **Time of Day**: Different contract mixes during peak vs off-peak hours

**Scaling Formula:**
```
Quest Reward = Base Reward × Zone Multiplier × Difficulty Modifier × Demand Bonus

Zone Multiplier:  Friendly 1.0 | Mild 1.5 | Full 2.5 | Hardcore 5.0
Difficulty Mod:   Easy 1.0 | Medium 1.5 | Hard 2.5 | Very Hard 4.0
Demand Bonus:     Normal 1.0 | High 1.3 | Critical 1.8
```

## Monetization (F2P)

### Revenue Model Overview

Odyssey is free-to-play with three monetization pillars:
1. **Premium Currency (NOVA)** - Tradeable for OMEN
2. **Vanity Skins** - Cosmetic customization
3. **Learning Acceleration** - Faster skill progression

---

### NOVA - Premium Currency

NOVA is the real-money currency that bridges cash and the player economy.

#### How NOVA Works

```
Real Money → Buy NOVA → Trade to Players for OMEN → Spend OMEN in-game
                ↓
         Players sell OMEN → Receive NOVA → Cash out (future?) or hold
```

#### NOVA Pricing

| Package | NOVA | Price (USD) | Bonus |
|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| Starter | 100 | $0.99 | - |
| Basic | 500 | $4.99 | - |
| Standard | 1,100 | $9.99 | +10% |
| Premium | 2,400 | $19.99 | +20% |
| Elite | 6,500 | $49.99 | +30% |
| Ultimate | 14,000 | $99.99 | +40% |

#### NOVA → OMEN Exchange

| Method | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Player Market** | List NOVA for sale, players buy with OMEN |
| **Direct Trade** | Trade NOVA to specific player for OMEN |

**Exchange Rate:**
- Set by player market (supply/demand)
- No fixed rate - fluctuates
- Typical range: 1 NOVA = 100-500 OMEN (varies by economy)

#### Why This Model Works

**For Paying Players:**
- Convert money to in-game wealth
- Skip grinding for OMEN
- Support the game

**For Free Players:**
- Earn OMEN through gameplay
- Buy NOVA from paying players
- Access premium items without spending real money

**For the Economy:**
- OMEN stays player-driven
- No direct item sales that unbalance game
- Paying players fund free players' content

---

### Vanity Skins

Cosmetic-only items that do not affect gameplay.

#### Skin Categories

| Category | Examples | Price Range (NOVA) |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| **Ship Skins** | Hull colors, patterns, effects | 200-2,000 |
| **Engine Trails** | Exhaust effects, colors | 100-500 |
| **Weapon Effects** | Laser colors, impact visuals | 150-800 |

---

### Learning Acceleration Points (LAP)

Speed up skill progression without skipping content.

#### How LAP Works

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Effect** | Multiplies XP gained in skill trees |
| **Duration** | Time-based (hours of active play) |
| **Stacking** | Multiple LAP buffs do NOT stack |
| **Cap** | Cannot exceed 2x XP multiplier |

#### LAP Packages

| Package | Duration | Multiplier | Price (NOVA) |
|---------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Quick Boost** | 1 hour | 1.5x | 50 |
| **Day Pass** | 8 hours | 1.5x | 300 |
| **Week Pass** | 40 hours | 1.5x | 1,200 |
| **Month Pass** | 160 hours | 1.5x | 4,000 |
| **Focused Boost** | 4 hours | 2.0x | 400 |

**Note:** Hours are *active play time*, not real time. AFK does not consume LAP.

#### LAP Philosophy

**What LAP Does:**
- Speeds up skill leveling
- Reach higher tiers faster
- Catch up to veteran players

**What LAP Does NOT Do:**
- Grant instant skill levels
- Unlock blueprints directly
- Provide any combat advantage
- Skip gameplay requirements

**Balance Reasoning:**
- Time is the only thing being sold
- Player still must play the game
- No items, stats, or power sold
- Veterans have no permanent advantage over dedicated free players

---

### What is NOT Sold

Maintaining competitive integrity:

| Item | Reason |
|------|--------|
| **Equipment/Ships** | Would break player-crafted economy |
| **Resources/Materials** | Would devalue gatherers |
| **Blueprints** | Must be earned through gameplay |
| **Direct Power** | No stats, damage, or advantages |
| **Skill Levels** | Only acceleration, not skipping |
| **OMEN Directly** | Only via player trading (NOVA) |
| **Inventory Space** | Earned through storage upgrades |
| **Exclusive Gameplay** | All content accessible to free players |

---

### Monetization Ethics

#### Principles
1. **No Pay-to-Win** - Money cannot buy power
2. **Respect Time** - Paying players save time, not skip content
3. **Player Economy** - Money flows through players, not bypasses them
4. **Cosmetic Focus** - Most revenue from vanity items
5. **Transparent Value** - Clear pricing, no predatory mechanics

#### Anti-Predatory Measures

| Measure | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Spending Limits** | Optional monthly cap setting |
| **Purchase History** | Clear transaction records |
| **No Loot Boxes** | Direct purchase only, no gambling |
| **Refund Window** | 24-hour refund on unused NOVA items |
| **Age Verification** | Parental controls for minors |
| **No FOMO Pressure** | Limited items return in rotation |

---

### Revenue Projections (Conceptual)

| Source | % of Revenue | Notes |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| **NOVA Sales** | 50% | Primary revenue driver |
| **Battle Pass** | 25% | Seasonal recurring |
| **Direct Skin Sales** | 20% | Whale spending |
| **LAP Sales** | 5% | Supplementary |

---

### Free vs Paying Player Experience

| Aspect | Free Player | Paying Player |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **All Content** | ✅ Full access | ✅ Full access |
| **Progression Speed** | Normal | Faster (with LAP) |
| **OMEN Earning** | Gameplay only | Can buy via NOVA |
| **Cosmetics** | Limited (events, achievements) | Full access |
| **Competitive Viability** | ✅ Equal | ✅ Equal |
| **Time Investment** | Higher | Lower |

### Travel Methods

#### 1. Local Travel (Within System)

Movement within a single star system.

| Method | Speed | Fuel Cost | Use Case |
|--------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Sub-light** | Slow | None | Short distances, combat |
| **In-system Warp** | Fast | Low | Planet to planet |
| **Autopilot** | Medium | Low | AFK travel, safe zones |

**In-system Warp:**
- Point-to-point instant travel
- Requires warp drive charge (5-30 seconds based on distance)
- Can be disrupted by Warp Scramblers
- Leaves warp signature (trackable briefly)

#### 2. Inter-system Travel (Between Systems)

Travel between star systems via Jump Gates or Jump Drives.

| Method | Speed | Cost | Requirements |
|--------|-------|------|--------------|
| **Jump Gate** | Instant | Toll (OMEN) | Gate access |
| **Jump Drive** | Instant | Fuel (high) | Ship module |
| **Wormhole** | Instant | Free | Find entrance |

---

### Jump Gates

Fixed structures connecting major systems. Primary method of inter-system travel.

#### Gate Network

| Route | Toll Cost | Zone at Gate |
|-------|-----------|--------------|
| Uurf ↔ Banx | 500 OMEN | Friendly |
| Uurf ↔ Spira | 500 OMEN | Friendly |
| Banx ↔ Spira | 500 OMEN | Friendly |
| Banx ↔ Cryo Haven | 1,000 OMEN | Friendly |
| Banx ↔ Dust Port | 1,000 OMEN | Mild |
| Banx ↔ Nexus Gate | 1,500 OMEN | Mild |
| Dust Port ↔ Nexus Gate | 2,000 OMEN | Full |
| Nexus Gate ↔ Uncharted | 5,000 OMEN | Hardcore |

#### Gate Mechanics

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Activation** | Approach gate, pay toll, instant jump |
| **Cooldown** | 60 seconds before next gate use |
| **Cargo Scan** | Gates scan cargo (can't smuggle through) |
| **Gate Camps** | PvP common at gates in dangerous zones |
| **Gate Guns** | Friendly zone gates have defense turrets |

#### Gate Camp Dangers

Gates in Mild/Full/Hardcore zones are prime ganking locations:
- Gankers wait on exit side
- No gate guns to protect you
- Must fight or escape immediately
- Scout before jumping recommended

---

### Jump Drives

Ship-mounted module for direct system-to-system travel without gates.

#### Jump Drive Tiers

| Tier | Range | Fuel Cost | Charge Time | Ship Size |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| T3 | Adjacent systems | 500 fuel | 60s | M+ |
| T5 | 2 systems | 1,000 fuel | 45s | M+ |
| T7 | 3 systems | 2,000 fuel | 30s | L+ |
| T8 | Any system | 5,000 fuel | 15s | L+ |

**Jump Drive Advantages:**
- Bypass gate camps
- No toll fees
- Choose entry point (not fixed gate location)
- Element of surprise

**Jump Drive Disadvantages:**
- High fuel cost
- Requires large ship
- Expensive to craft
- Creates jump signature (detectable)

---

### Fuel System

All warp and jump travel consumes fuel.

#### Fuel Types

| Fuel | Source | Used For |
|------|--------|----------|
| **Standard Fuel** | Refined hydrogen | In-system warp |
| **Jump Fuel** | Helium-3 + Xenon | Jump drives |
| **Emergency Fuel** | Crafted | Single emergency warp |

#### Fuel Consumption

| Action | Fuel Cost |
|--------|-----------|
| In-system warp (short) | 10-50 units |
| In-system warp (long) | 50-200 units |
| Jump drive activation | 500-5,000 units |
| Afterburner (per minute) | 20 units |

#### Fuel Capacity by Ship Size

| Size | Fuel Tank | Range (approx) |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| XS | 500 units | 5-10 warps |
| S | 1,000 units | 10-20 warps |
| M | 2,500 units | 25-50 warps |
| L | 5,000 units | 50-100 warps |
| XL | 10,000 units | 100+ warps |

#### Refueling

| Location | Cost | Speed |
|----------|------|-------|
| Major city station | Market price | Instant |
| Outpost | +20% markup | Instant |
| Ship refinery | Craft from gases | Slow |
| Fuel drone | Automated | Medium |

**Running Out of Fuel:**
- Ship is stranded
- Must call for tow (expensive)
- Or wait for rescue
- Sitting duck for gankers

---

### Wormholes

Random spawning connections to distant or hidden locations.

| Type | Destination | Duration | Danger |
|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| **Stable** | Known system | 24 hours | Varies |
| **Unstable** | Random system | 1-4 hours | High |
| **Ancient** | Uncharted space | 30 min | Extreme |
| **Anomaly** | Hidden locations | 10 min | Unknown |

**Wormhole Mechanics:**
- Spawn randomly in space
- Detectable by deep scanners
- Two-way travel (usually)
- Collapse after time limit or mass limit
- Can be camped by players

**Wormhole Hunting:**
- Lucrative exploration activity
- Find shortcuts to valuable areas
- Sell wormhole locations to others
- Risk: Unknown what's on other side
