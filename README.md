## 🌌 Rich Storyline & Cosmic Elements

### **The Lost Thirteenth Ship**
Players are descendants of humanity's secret thirteenth arkship that discovered the **Galaxy of Spira** through experimental wormhole technology. The story weaves together dimensional exploration, ancient mysteries, and the search for cosmic meaning.

### **OMEN: Fragments of Universal Consciousness**
The game's currency system represents fragments of the **Prime Convergence** - the universe's first moment of self-awareness. Players progress through five cosmic awakening thresholds:

| Threshold | OMEN Range | Cosmic Ability |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **The Whisper** | 1-100 | Basic awareness of cosmic interconnection |
| **The Echo** | 101-1,000 | Perception of causal networks |
| **The Resonance** | 1,001-10,000 | Direct connection to cosmic web |
| **The Convergence** | 10,001-100,000 | Participation in universal consciousness |
| **The Unity** | 100,000+ | Transcendence of individual perspective |
